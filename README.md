taxRAG
Overview
taxRAG is a powerful tax assistant built using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, designed to help users generate accurate and insightful tax-related information. The project combines the power of web scraping, machine learning, and LangChain’s RAG framework to deliver real-time tax insights through an intelligent chatbot interface.

Key Features
RAG Pipeline with LangChain: The core of this project is built on LangChain, which powers the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This allows the chatbot to provide precise and context-aware answers by retrieving relevant tax data and generating responses on the fly.
Data Sourced via Web Scraping: Tax data is dynamically retrieved by scraping information from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) website (https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/), ensuring that the information provided is up-to-date and accurate.
Ollama's Command-R for Model Training: The chatbot is powered by a model trained using Ollama's Command-R. This ensures that the tax assistant provides nuanced and highly relevant responses to user queries.
Custom Tax Reports: Users can generate tailored tax reports based on the most recent data, making tax compliance easier for both individuals and businesses.
Usage
This project is ideal for tax professionals, businesses, and individuals looking to streamline their tax-related processes. The chatbot interface allows users to ask specific tax questions and receive accurate, data-driven responses.
