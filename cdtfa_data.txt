California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA)

The mission of the CDTFA is to make life better for Californians by fairly and efficiently collecting the revenue that supports our essential public services.

The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) administers California's sales and use, fuel, tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis taxes, as well as a variety of other taxes and fees that fund specific state programs. CDTFA administered programs collect over $90 billion annually which in turn supports local essential services such as transportation, public safety and health, libraries, schools, social services, and natural resource management programs through the distribution of tax dollars going directly to local communities.
Tax programs administered by the CDTFA are concentrated in two general areas – sales and use, and special taxes and fees.
To best serve our customers, the CDTFA has offices throughout the state along with offices located in New York, Chicago, and Houston. While the CDTFA team is spread out geographically, we are united in working together to serve taxpayers and feepayers.

Retailers engaged in business in California must register with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) and pay the state's sales tax, which applies to all retail sales of goods and merchandise except those sales specifically exempted by law. The use tax generally applies to the storage, use, or other consumption in California of goods purchased from retailers in transactions not subject to the sales tax. Use tax may also apply to purchases shipped to a California consumer from another state, including purchases made by mail order, telephone, or Internet.
					
The sales and use tax rate in a specific California location has three parts: the state tax rate, the local tax rate,
						and any district tax rate that may be in effect.
State sales and use taxes provide revenue to the state's General Fund, to cities and counties through specific state
						fund allocations, and to other local jurisdictions.

Limited Access Code Removal




LIMITED ACCESS CODES ARE BEING REMOVED!


On June 30, 2022, CDTFA stopped issuing Limited Access Codes for new business activity registrations. All new business registrations are now required to complete the Sign Up Now process to create a username and password or use a previously created logon to complete any new registrations. This process launched our efforts to remove Limited Access Codes from the online service experience. Removal of the codes enhances security and enhances your overall online services customer experience.
The table below outlines the dates when Limited Access Codes will be removed. The removal of the Limited Access Code will be based on your logon status and account filing basis. If you have multiple accounts each with a different filing basis, under the same ownership, all your Limited Access Codes will be removed in accordance with the earliest date and filing basis below.

A letter will be mailed to the business address on record identifying the Limited Access Code removal date for your accounts. The letter will be mailed prior to the removal date and contain security code(s) to assist the owner of the business in creating a logon to gain access to their account(s). The letter will be mailed prior to the scheduled removal date.
We recommended you create a logon prior to the scheduled Limited Access Code removal date to avoid filing and payment delays. Please complete the Sign Up Now process to create your logon.

What if I have a third-party delegate that files and makes payments on my behalf?

Will my security code(s) expire?

The security code(s) will expire 90 days from the date on the letter. 

I am a third-party delegate and I file returns using the Limited Access Code on behalf of my clients, what do I need to do?


If you do not have a logon, you need to create a logon and request access to your client's account(s). Once logged in, select the Request Access to an Account link under the I Want To section to gain access to your client's account(s) using the security code(s) provided by your client. To create a third-party delegate logon, go to Sign Up Now and follow the instructions for third-party delegate.

If your client does not have the security code(s) to their account(s), you will need to login and select the Request Access to an Account link under the I Want To section and indicate you do not have a security code. A security code letter will be mailed to the address on file for your client. Once your client receives the security code, please follow the steps above. If you need to gain access to multiple accounts, you will need to complete this process for each.

The security code(s) provided from the owner to a third-party representative will grant them All Access to the account and the ability to create and manage secondary user logons.

I have multiple accounts with multiple filing basis, how will my Limited Access Code removal date be determined?

What Relief May Be Requested?

Español ä¸­å½äºº Tiếng Việt íêµ­ì¸

You may now request relief from penalty and/or interest, relief from collection cost recovery fees, submit a declaration of timely mailing, and request a return extension using our online services, as described below:
Relief from Penalty
We may grant relief from penalty charges if it is determined that you failed to timely file or pay, or failed to pay using the correct payment method, due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond your control. Your request may not be processed until the tax/fee has been paid in full. If you are relieved of the penalty charges, you must still pay the interest due on late return payments and prepayments or billings issued.
Relief from Interest due to an unreasonable error or delay by CDTFA or the DMV
We may grant relief of interest only for the reasons shown below. If we approve your request, all or part of the interest may be relieved.

An unreasonable error or delay by a CDTFA employee acting in their official capacity and no significant aspect of the error or delay is attributable to your actions or your failure to act; or
An error by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in calculating the amount of sales or use tax due on your DMV registered vehicle or vessel.

Relief from Penalty and Interest Due to a Disaster
If you are a disaster victim, we may grant relief from penalty and interest charges if it is determined that you failed to timely file or pay due to a disaster, or failed to pay using the correct payment method, due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond your control. (State of Emergency Tax Relief guide)
Relief from Collection Cost Recovery Fee
A Collection Cost Recovery Fee (CRF) is applied to most past due liabilities that remain unpaid for more than 90 days. We may grant relief from the CRF if it is determined that failure to pay a past due liability was due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond your control. Your request cannot be processed until the liability (tax/fee, interest, and penalty) for which the CRF was assessed has been paid in full.
Declaration of Timely Mailing
A Declaration of Timely Mailing (DTM) may be submitted when a penalty and interest on a liability were assessed for a document that was mailed timely but postmarked after the due date.
Extension of Time in Which to File a Tax/Fee Return
You may request an extension if additional time is needed to file your tax or fee return/prepayment and/or payment. The due date may be extended by one month and the late filing and/or late payment penalties may be waived.
While each type of request has different requirements, any taxpayer, or their representative, with the appropriate security level, can use the system to make their requests. Please see our frequently asked questions (FAQ) for more details. Property Railroad Car Taxpayers should contact the State-Assessed Properties Division at 1-916-274-3270.
Note: Relief requests cannot be submitted for Surplus Line Broker Tax accounts.
What do I need to get started?
You will need your account number. You can log in with your username and password. You can log in here to begin.
How do I apply?
To submit a request for relief, log in with your username and password and select the account you want to request relief for. The Submit a Relief Request option is located under the I Want To section, More subsection. Simply select the Submit a Relief Request link and follow the prompts.
To submit an Extension of Time in Which to File a Tax/Fee Return, log in with your username and password and select the account you want to request an extension for. The Request a Filing Extension option is located under the I Want To section, select Request a Filing Extension link and follow the prompts.
To review your submitted request, log in in with your username and password, select your account, then select the Submissions tab.
If you do not have a username and password, you can start your request with a CDTFA-735, Request for Relief from Penalty, Collection Cost Recovery Fee, and/or Interest form.

Customs Statement of Proposed Liability (CDTFA-537)
Why did I receive this letter?

We received information from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) indicating that you imported items into California for storage, use, or other consumption in this state during the previous calendar year.Â  The amount listed on this letter is the tax due for the declared value of the imports for the identified year.
Generally, if sales tax would apply when you buy physical merchandise in California, use tax applies when you make a similar purchase without tax from a business located outside the state. For these purchases, you are required to pay the use tax separately. Use tax is due on or before April 15 following the year in which the purchase was made.

What do I need to do?


Visit our Online Services webpage. Click the Respond to a Letter/Inquiry link under Limited Access Functions and use the Letter ID and date listed at the top of this letter to proceed. There you will be able to view the import information.


What if I disagree with the amount due?

If you believe use tax is not due, you will still need to file a return, claim an exemption, and upload copies of your supporting documentation. If a return or payment is not received within 15 days from the date of the letter, a Notice of Determination (billing) may be issued to you, as authorized by section 6481 of the Sales and Use Tax Law.

Report Suspected Tax Fraud Activity
At the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) we have an Investigations team whose job it is to identify tax evasion problems, identify new fraud schemes, and actively investigate and assist in the prosecution of crimes committed by individuals who are violating the laws administered by the Department. Tax fraud hurts everyone, so help us help you.
File A Tax Evasion Complaint
Types of evasion:
Cannabis Tax Evasion

In general, cannabis retailers are responsible for collecting the cannabis excise tax from their customers based on gross receipts from the retail sale of cannabis or cannabis products, along with reporting and paying the cannabis excise tax due to CDTFA.
Under the California Revenue and Taxation Code, any person who willfully evades or attempts in any manner to evade the reporting, assessment, or payment of the cannabis excise tax, or the sales tax that would otherwise be due may be guilty of cannabis tax evasion or sales tax evasion. Violators are subject to fines and/or jail time.
Cannabis tax evasion and sales tax evasion hurts honest businesses in the regulated cannabis industry. Cannabis and cannabis products can be sold at a lower price when the taxes are not paid, which allows the seller to gain more customers and illegally earn increased profits. Additionally, when cannabis excise taxes or sales taxes are not paid, those dollars are not available for the various programs such as, research on the impacts of cannabis on public health, the effectiveness of cannabis use for treatment, and youth education.
Examples of cannabis excise tax evasion include, but are not limited to:

Any person illegally growing cannabis for sale in the illegal cannabis market.
Possessing, owning, storing, or selling cannabis or cannabis products without a proper commercial cannabis license with the Department of Cannabis Control.
Cannabis or cannabis products are not contained in secured packaging when sold in a retail sale.
Any person required to be licensed as a cannabis retailer and intentionally does not collect the cannabis excise tax.


Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Evasion

Any person who intentionally evades the reporting, assessment or payment of cigarette or tobacco products taxes that would otherwise be due is guilty of cigarette or tobacco products tax evasion. And as of 2004, any retailer, wholesaler, or distributor of cigarettes and tobacco products and any manufacturer or importer of cigarettes that does not comply with the licensing requirements of the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act (CTPLA) of 2003 may receive fines up to $5,000 per offense, imprisonment up to one year in county jail, or both fines and imprisonment.
Tax evasion hurts all of us by reducing the amount of revenue available for essential state and local services. Nearly 90% of the taxes collected on cigarettes and tobacco products are earmarked to fund important programs such as breast cancer research, health education, hospital and physician services, research, public resources, and county-run projects for child health and development.
Cigarette and tobacco products tax evasion also hurts the honest business owner. Unscrupulous sellers of untaxed cigarettes and tobacco products can undercut the prices charged by the legitimate businessperson. And evasion is accompanied by an increase in thefts, hijackings, cross-border smuggling, and other organized crimes.
Cigarette or tobacco products tax evasion includes such actions as:
Sale of unstamped cigarettes or untaxed tobacco products.
Intentionally importing tobacco products from outside the state without remitting the appropriate California State tobacco products taxes.
Sale of cigarettes with counterfeit or reused tax stamps.
Possessing, owning, storing or selling untaxed cigarettes or tobacco products (unless licensed as a distributor, manufacturer or importer).
Violations of the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003 include such actions as:
Sale or distribution of cigarettes or tobacco products without a license.
Not obtaining and maintaining a valid license for each location selling cigarettes or tobacco products.
Not displaying your license in public view.
Not maintaining purchase or sales records, as required.
Refusing access of purchase or sales records to authorized inspectors or enforcement staff.
Selling cigarettes or tobacco products to individuals under 21 years of age (STAKE Act).
Selling cigarettes or roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco in California that are not listed in the California Tobacco Directory.

Fuel Tax Evasion

Under the California Revenue and Taxation Code, any person who intentionally evades the reporting, assessment or payment of fuel taxes that would otherwise be due is guilty of fuel tax evasion. Violators are subject to fines and/or jail time. See the Special Taxes and Fees Tax Rates page for current fuel tax rates.
Fuel tax evasion hurts honest businesses. Fuel can be sold at a lower price when the tax is not paid, which allows the seller to gain more customers and illegally earn increased profits. When fuel taxes are not paid, those dollars are not available for a variety of transportation uses; primarily for the construction and maintenance of our roads and highways.
Examples of fuel tax evasion include, but are not limited to:
Using dyed (untaxed) diesel fuel in a vehicle operated on California highways without being licensed to remit the tax.
Intentionally importing fuel from outside the state without remitting the appropriate California State fuel taxes.
Blending taxable fuel with an untaxed product to increase volume without paying tax on the increase.
Fuel tax evasion is bad for the environment. Illegally blended fuels can cause increased soil and air pollution. These result from poor combustion and contamination from toxic or waste chemicals used as blending agents. In addition, illegally blended fuels often cause increased engine wear and can lead to vehicle breakdowns.

Sales Tax Evasion

Under the California Revenue and Taxation Code, any person who intentionally evades the reporting, assessment or payment of sales taxes that would otherwise be due is guilty of sales tax evasion. Violators are subject to fines and/or jail time.
Examples of sales tax evasion include, but are not limited to:
Retailers collect sales tax reimbursement from their customers on sales but intentionally fail to report and pay the tax collected.
Retailers intentionally fail to report all retail sales on which sales tax is due.
In general, retail sales of tangible personal property in California are subject to sales tax. The responsibility for paying the sales tax is upon the seller (retailer). The sales tax rate varies statewide; however, the statewide tax rate base is 7.25 percent. Sales taxes are higher in locations where voters have approved additional "district taxes." See the Sales and Use Tax Rates page to find the current sales tax rate for your location.
Sales tax supports a broad range of state services, from parks to prisons. In addition, sales tax is a major source of revenue for many cities and counties, which depend on the income for police and fire service, courts, roads, health care, and more. Tax evasion hurts all of us by reducing the amount of money available for these essential services, and honest businesses are placed in a competitive disadvantage by deceitful sellers who do not pay the tax they owe.

Taxpayers' Rights Advocate Annual Reports
Taxpayers' Bill of Rights Annual Meeting
Tax Appeals Assistance Program (TAAP)










Taxpayers' Rights Advocate Office
The Taxpayers' Rights Advocate (TRA) Office helps tax and feepayers when they are unable to resolve a matter through normal channels, when they want information regarding procedures relating to a particular set of circumstances, or when there are apparent rights violations in the audit, or collection of taxes or fees. Some taxpayers call to communicate their frustration with aspects of the business taxation system or seeking confirmation that they have been treated lawfully and fairly by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA).
In cases where the law, policy, or procedure does not allow any change to the team member's action, but a change appears justified, the TRA Office is alerted to a potential area that may need clarification or modification. Several past recommendations for policy, procedural, and legislative changes have resulted from these types of contacts with taxpayers.
The TRA office facilitates communication to eliminate potential misunderstandings. Taxpayers are provided information on policies and procedures so they can be better prepared to discuss their issues with the appropriate staff and increase the opportunity to affect a resolution which will satisfy them. As the small business liaison for the CDTFA, the TRA Office is available to assist small businesses in resolving problems regarding compliance with the relevant regulations and statutes after normal channels have failed.
2024 Taxpayers' Bill of Rights Meeting
Thursday, August 22, 2024, beginning at 9:30 a.m.
Taxpayers and stakeholders are invited to this year's Taxpayers' Bill of Rights meeting to present ideas and concerns on the tax and fee programs administered by CDTFA. Anyone can participate in person, by phone, or by submitting comments via email. For more information, visit the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights meeting webpage.
Your Rights as a Taxpayer
Right to Prompt, Courteous, and Fair Treatment
You have the right to have your problems resolved in a quick, courteous, and professional manner. Our employees will treat you with dignity and respect and must apply the law fairly and consistently.

Right to Confidentiality
You can feel secure knowing the CDTFA will keep your personal and financial information confidential. Tax information is only disclosed to other state and federal agencies as provided by law.

Right to Information
The CDTFA continues to try and provide easy to understand information to help you comply with the various tax and fee laws.

Rights During an Audit
If you are audited, you have the right to a fair examination and a clear explanation of the audit process. In addition, you may speak with the auditorâs supervisor if you do not understand or agree with the audit.

Right to pay no more than the correct amount you owe
You should promptly pay the full amount of taxes that you owe. (In general, we do not take collection action on an amount you owe until after we give you an opportunity to pay.) We prefer to establish a payment arrangement rather than take enforcement action against you such as file a tax lien, levy, and/or wage garnishment. If you cannot pay your tax liability in full, then you may be eligible to make installment payments.
If you cannot pay what you owe immediately, you have the right to:

Meet with a supervisor.
Request copies of your file.
Request a hardship hearing to show that a collection action is causing a financial hardship.
Receive notification 30 days before we file a lien.


Your Responsibilities

Stay informed about tax laws and regulations that affect your business.
Report and pay taxes and fees when due.
Promptly respond to  CDTFA attempts to contact you.
Inform the  CDTFA of changes to your business ownership or address.
Maintain adequate records.

Public Access to Programs, Services and Facilities by Persons with Disabilities – Policy and Grievance Procedure
Public Access Policy
It is the policy of the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) to provide access to its programs, services and facilities to persons with disabilities in accordance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134), its implementing regulation (28 C.F.R., part 35), and other applicable federal and state laws. Relevant sections of the 28 C.F.R., part 35 are linked to below.
Documents in alternative formats and other reasonable accommodations may be requested by disabled members of the public or their representatives from CDTFA's ADA Coordinator, Diversity and Inclusion Office, P.O. Box 942879 MIC: 51, Sacramento, CA 94279-0051, 1-916-309-8400 (voice) or 711 (TTY). As necessary, the ADA Coordinator will direct appropriate team members to assist in complying with CDTFA's public access policy.
This policy addresses public access by persons with disabilities. Inquiries concerning CDTFA's efforts to make its employment practices nondiscriminatory as to persons with disabilities under Title I of the ADA should be directed to to the Department's Diversity and Inclusion Office, P.O. Box 942879 MIC: 51, Sacramento, CA 94279-0051, 1-916-309-8400 (voice) or 711 (TTY).
Public Access Grievance Procedure
In the event a request for access to programs, services or facilities cannot be resolved with the assistance of CDTFA's ADA Coordinator, a grievance may be filed with CDTFA's Diversity and Inclusion Office, P.O. Box 942879 MIC: 51, Sacramento, CA 94279-0051, 1-916-309-8400 (voice) or 711 (TTY).
The steps of CDTFA's ADA Title II grievance procedure are set forth below:
Step 1. The grievance should be filed on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Grievance Form (CDTFA-351) linked to below. If the grievance is not filed on CDTFA-351, it should nonetheless contain the following information: 

The name, address, and phone number of the person filing the grievance; 
The name, address, and phone number of the person alleging the ADA violation, if other than the person filing the grievance; 
The name of the CDTFA service, program or facility allegedly in violation.
A description of the alleged violation and the remedy sought;
Information regarding whether a complaint has been filed with the Department of Justice or other federal or state civil rights agency or courts.
If a complaint has been filed, the name of the agency or court where the complaint was filed, the date the complaint was filed, and the name, address and telephone number of a contact person with the agency with which the complaint was filed.

CDTFA's ADA Coordinator is available to individuals requiring assistance to file a grievance. CDTFA's communications regarding the grievance will be in a format accessible to the grievant. 
Step 2. Consistent with Administrative Manual section 7900, the Diversity and Inclusion (D and I) Office will respond or acknowledge the grievance within 12 working days of receipt.
Step 3. Within 60 calendar days of receipt, the D and I Office will complete the investigation necessary to determine the validity of the alleged violation. If appropriate, the D and I Office will arrange to meet with the grievant to discuss the matter and attempt to reach an informal resolution of the grievance. Any informal resolution of the grievance shall be documented in the D and I Office file.
Step 4. If an informal resolution of the grievance is not reached in Step 3, within 75 calendar days of receipt of the grievance, a written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of the resolution, if appropriate, shall be forwarded to the Legal Division, Litigation Bureau and the D and I Manager for review and approval. 
Step 5. The D and I Office will convey CDTFA's determination and resolution to the grievant within 90 calendar days of receipt of the grievance, unless the D and I Manager authorizes additional time for further consideration of the grievance. Upon approval, any authorized extension of time will be communicated by the D and I Office to the grievant.
Step 6. Any request for reconsideration of CDTFA's response to the grievance shall be at the discretion of the Director.
If the grievant is dissatisfied with CDTFA's handling of the grievance at any stage of the process or does not wish to file a grievance through CDTFA's ADA Title II Grievance Procedure, the grievant may file a complaint directly with the U. S. Department of Justice or other appropriate state or federal agency. Use of CDTFA's grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. 
The resolution of any specific grievance will require consideration of varying circumstances, such as the specific nature of the disability; the nature of the access to services, programs, or facilities at issue, the essential eligibility requirements for participation; the health and safety of others; and the degree to which an accommodation would constitute a fundamental alteration to the program, service, or facility, or cause an undue hardship to CDTFA. Accordingly, the resolution by CDTFA of any one grievance does not constitute a precedent upon which CDTFA is bound or upon which other complaining parties may rely.

Classes for Cigarette and Tobacco Product Retailers
Coming in 2024 Cigarette and Tobacco Product Retailer live MS Teams webinars. These webinars are for retailers who sell or plan to sell cigarettes or tobacco products in California (includes "vaping" products containing nicotine). This class is designed to inform, answer questions, and help retailers understand the state's requirements and their responsibilities as a vendor of tobacco products in California. During the class we will cover topics such as:

Who must be licensed
Sales of electronic smoking (vaping) devices such as eCigarettes
What to expect during a CDTFA inspection
What records you must maintain at your business location
What violations can result in the seizure of your products
Recent changes in law that may affect your sales of tobacco products
What rights you have as a taxpayer, and much more…

If you are unable to attend you may review the class information online at Cigarettes and Tobacco Products Online Seminar for Retailers. The information provided in this tutorial is similar to that covered in the webinar.




Sales Tax Educational Opportunities
Online Tutorial for Sales and Use Tax – As an alternative to attending an instructor led class you can try our tutorial online, which provides the information in a self-paced environment.
Basic Sales and Use Tax Class – This instructor led class assists taxpayers in the following areas:

Preparing a sales and use tax return
Supporting and reporting exempt sales
Using a resale certificate
Determining what is taxable and non-taxable labor
Maintaining adequate records


Sales and Use Tax Return Preparation Class – This instructor led class assists taxpayers in preparing a sales and use tax return. Participants are encouraged to bring in their own sales and use tax return along with any documentation pertaining to that return period.

Recordkeeping Class – What records should you keep, how detailed, and for how long? What needs to be reflected on your receipts? Learn how to verify a seller's permit and use resale certificates for your protection. Determine proper documentation in foreign and interstate commerce, as well as other common exemptions and deductions. You'll discover how good recordkeeping will reduce your fear of audit and improve your business operation.

Tax Seminar for Nonprofit and Exempt Organizations – Many are surprised to learn that there is no blanket exemption and that a sellers’ permit is required for most nonprofits. Get the rules that apply to your particular 501(c)(3), religious, youth, veteran, school, fraternal or other charitable organization. You’ll receive instruction on holding that spaghetti dinner or pancake breakfast, selling gift baskets, conducting raffles, and other taxable fund raisers.

Taxpayer Educational Consultation Program (TECP) – This free program is designed to provide individualized tax education and assistance to new taxpayers that started a business in the last twelve months and filed at least two sales and use tax returns. You will receive a one-on-one consultation from a trained staff member who will review your business operations and recordkeeping system. Consultations are not audits, however, you will need to provide the staff member with access to your books and records so we can provide you with the best information and help make your business a success. To participate, or for more information and to verify if your business qualifies, please contact your local office today to schedule an appointment.

Make a Payment or Prepayment

Make a Payment
We offer convenient payment methods for those with current and past due liabilities. If you are filing a return, you can pay any taxes or fees due at the same time. Payments can be made directly from your bank account, credit card, check, or by money order. Some of our taxpayers are required to make payments by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
Who can pay online?
You can pay online unless you are paying one of the following special taxes and fees accounts:

Insurance Tax accounts (includes Home Protection Insurance, Life Insurance, Ocean Marine Insurance, Property and Casualty Insurance, Surplus Line Brokers, Title Insurance)
Public Warehouse
Activity Fee
Use tax payment for one-time purchases from out-of-state retailer

What are my online payment options?
Pay Directly from Your Bank Account
This option allows funds to be electronically withdrawn from your bank account using your bank routing number and your bank account number. There is no fee to use this service.
To make a payment online, visit CDTFA's Online Services Login Page. You can find more information in our Online Payments — Frequently Asked Questions.
Pay by Credit Card
   
Please note: A service fee of 2.3% of the transaction amount will be charged by the credit card processing vendor. This service fee is retained by the vendor and is not revenue to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). The minimum service fee is $1.00.

Credit Card Payment
Frequently Asked Questions

Pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Payment
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) is a method for financial institutions to transfer funds from one account to another, eliminating the use of paper checks. Some tax and fee payers are required to pay by EFT.

Log in to make your EFT payment and file your return in one transaction.
Third Party Vendor — Initiate a separate EFT payment through the state data collector.
EFT Frequently Asked Questions

Are there other payment options?
Pay by Check or Money Order

If you prefer to pay by sending us a check or money order instead of paying through our online system, there is an option to print a payment voucher after you file your return. We recommend all checks and money orders be mailed with a payment voucher. All billing notices and Statement of Account notices include a payment voucher. Prepayment vouchers can also be printed through our online services system by clicking the “Make a Payment” button on our Online Services Login Page, then choosing “Print a Prepayment Voucher.” We will process your check the same day it is received. This means the funds will be withdrawn from your account the day we receive your check.
Make your check or money order payable to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
Write your CDTFA account number on your check or money order.
Deliver via one of the following methods:
                            
Mail your payment and payment voucher to:

                                    California Department of Tax and Fee Administration
                                    PO Box 942879
                                    Sacramento CA 94279-7072

Send your payment and payment voucher via private courier (8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Mon-Fri) or overnight delivery service to:

                                    California Department of Tax and Fee Administration
                                    651 Bannon Street, Suite 100
                                    Sacramento, CA 95811-0299

Hand delivery of a check or money order is acceptable at any public field office during normal business hours.



Our offices do not accept cash as a method of payment. You may contact your local CDTFA office to request an exemption if you must pay your taxes in cash.
Note: If you are a mandatory EFT participant and you use another means of payment (cash, check, credit card, etc.), your payment will be subject to a penalty.
Do you offer payment plans?
Yes. If you cannot pay your total past due amount now, you can request a payment plan, and pay down your balance over time. This could potentially keep you from incurring additional penalties and interest. For more information visit our Payment Plan page.
How do I claim a refund while making payments?
If you are making payments towards a Notice of Determination (billing) and believe you do not owe the amount due or believe you have been overcharged, you may now file a claim for refund using the CDTFA's Online Services Login page. To submit your claim for refund, login with your username and password and click on the account for which you want to request a refund. Then under the I Want To section click the More link. Then select the Submit a Claim for Refund link and follow the prompts. You may file one single timely claim for refund (CDTFA-101, Claim for Refund) to cover any prior payments within the applicable statute of limitations (see publications below for limitation periods), any current payments, and any subsequent payments applied to that billing. If you are disputing more than one billing, you must file a timely claim for refund for each separate billing.
For more information, see publication 17, Appeals Procedures and publication 117, Filing a Claim for Refund.

Please note that this Use Policy is subject to change without notice, and that it reflects the State's currently business practices. This policy is dated December 7, 2000.
Also note that each department within the State may have additional privacy and use policies specific to the mission and needs of their work. Be sure to review those policies as you access additional sites within the State.
Personal Information and Choice
"Personal information" is information about a natural person that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history, readily identifiable to that specific individual. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information, however, it is considered "electronically collected personal information".
According to Government Code § 11015.5, "Electronically collected personal information" means any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a state agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that business.
"Electronically collected personal information" we automatically collect includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e. completing a request for assistance, personalizing the content of the web site, sending an e-mail or participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the web site.
If any type of personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law, including Information Practices Act of 1977, Government Code Section 11015.5, and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information may be a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or state law.
Additionally, departments and agencies of the State of California are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy which is also accessible on this web site. Please see Department of General Services Management Memo 00-14, effective January 1, 2001.
A Special Note About Children
Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information and we require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information to the State as part of a user profile or personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you are a minor you should seek guidance from your parents.
If the state decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use for it. The state will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child's information and, if they choose, prohibit the state from making further use of their child's information. The state will not provide personal information about children to third parties.
Information Collected and How It is Used
We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to use some of our services. Collection of this information is required to deliver the specific services, but use of these services is voluntary.
If you do nothing during your visit to the web site, but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used but not the e-mail address.  The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer.  We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you and generate statistics used in the management of this site;
The type of browser and operating system you used;

The web pages or services you accessed at this site;
The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site;
The web site you visit as you leave this web site;

The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for gathering web site statistics. The information we automatically collect and store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our web site to continually improve the value of the materials available. Our web site logs do not identify a visitor by personal information, and we make no attempt to link other web sites with the individuals that browse the State's web site.
Government Code § 11015.5 (6) prohibits all state agencies from distributing or selling any electronically collected personal information as defined above, about users to any third party without the permission of the user. The State does not sell any "electronically collected personal information".  Any distribution of "electronically collected personal information" will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.
The State may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is sold or distributed and all relevant legal protections still apply to the State's web sites.
What Happens to Information You Submit to Us?
If you choose to submit information to us the information will be transmitted through secure lines to our departmental database. Any private information will only be used for the purposes for which it was provided and will not be shared with another entity except as prescribed by law. Please see our Privacy Policy for additional information.
Use of Internet Request for Assistance Form Information
Any information you provide to us will only be shared with entities involved in your case as necessary. Information you provide may be included with other consumers' information to be used for statistical reporting, trending data, and/or investigative actions. For example, we may need to retain information that becomes part of an enforcement action or consumer complaint case for a period of time after the closing date of the case.
If you provide us with information regarding an issue that does not fall within our regulatory jurisdiction, we may refer your information to the appropriate local, state, or federal agency on your behalf.

Beginning with the July 2022 and Third Quarter 2022 Filing Periods 
The cannabis tax return has been revised so you can report and pay any excess cultivation tax collected when fling 
your return beginning with the July 2022 and third quarter 2022 fling periods. 
What’s new for reporting the cultivation tax? 
Beginning July 1, 2022, the cultivation tax no longer applies to harvested cannabis or cannabis products entering the commercial market. Cannabis enters the commercial market when the cannabis or cannabis products pass the required testing and quality assurance review.

• Return any cultivation tax that was previously collected on harvested cannabis that did not enter the commercialmarket prior to July 1, 2022, to the cultivator that paid it. Keep documentation as evidence that the cultivation tax wasreturned and that you did not retain any excess cultivation tax. This documentation protects you from liability for anyexcess cultivation tax collected.
• Document any excess cultivation tax collected that cannot be returned to the cultivator that originally paid it, in orderto report and pay the tax on your next cannabis tax return.
How do I report excess cultivation tax collected? 
• Beginning with the July 2022 and third quarter 2022 fling periods, the cannabis tax return has been revised to includean excess cultivation tax line to report the total dollar amount of excess cultivation tax collected.
• If you are a manufacturer that has collected excess cultivation tax and cannot return it to the cultivator that originallypaid it, you must transfer the excess cultivation tax collected to a distributor for the distributor to report it on theirnext online cannabis tax return.
What do I do if I returned cultivation tax to the cultivator that paid it after I reported and paid it as excess cultivation tax collected?

Potential Legislation That May Impact Fuel Tax Rates
We are aware of proposals to change the laws for both sales and use tax and excise tax 
that may impact the sales tax prepayment rates and fuel tax rates.  If there are any changes made that will affect these tax rates, you will receive another notification from us.
How are the sales tax prepayment rates determined?
The prepayment rate for each gallon of gasoline, aircraft jet fuel, and diesel fuel is calculated at 80 percent of the combined state and local sales tax on the average selling price of the fuel, excluding sales tax, as reported by industry publications. By March 1 of each year, we are required to establish the sales tax prepayment rates. We may adjust these rates during the year if changes in fuel prices cause fuel retailers to prepay too much or too little tax. We will notify you by special notice if this occurs.
How are the excise tax rates determined?
We are required to adjust the motor vehicle fuel and diesel fuel excise tax rates on July 1 of each year. The yearly adjustments are based on the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index as calculated by the Department of Finance.

Beginning January 1, 2022, the cultivation tax rates reflect an adjustment for inflation as required by the Cannabis Tax Law. 
The adjusted rates for each category shown below will be reflected on the monthly and quarterly cannabis tax returns 
beginning January 1, 2022.
CANNABIS CATEGORYCURRENT RATE  
ENDING 12/31/2021NEW RATE EFFECTIVE 
1/1/2022
Flower per dry-weight ounce $9.65 $10.08

• On and after January 1, 2022, the new rates apply to cannabis that a cultivator sells or transfers to a manufacturer or 
distributor. 
• A cultivator’s cannabis sales or transfers made prior to January 1, 2022, will use the current rates listed above.
For current and prior cultivation tax rates, please see our Special Taxes and Fees  rate page at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm , under Cannabis Taxes . 
Cannabis Mark-up Rate
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) is responsible for determining the cannabis mark-up rate 
every six months. We have determined the cannabis mark-up rate will remain at 80 percent  through at least June 30, 2022. 
To make this determination, we analyzed statewide market data to calculate the mark-up rate between the wholesale cost 
and the retail selling price of cannabis and cannabis products. 
The mark-up rate is used by distributors to compute the average market price of cannabis or cannabis products sold 
or transferred to a retailer in an arm’s length transaction. In these transactions, the average market price is the retailer’s 
wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products plus the CDTFA mark-up rate. 
The 15 percent cannabis excise tax is based on the average market price of the cannabis or cannabis products sold in a 
retail sale. You can find examples of how to calculate the cannabis excise tax on our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  
under the Distributors  tab. 
For current and prior cannabis mark-up rates, please see our Special Taxes and Fees  rate page at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.ht m, under Cannabis Taxes .

Special Notice
Cigarette and Tobacco Products Distributors  
May Not Hold a Wholesaler License
A person, as defined in Revenue and Taxation Code (R&TC) section 30010, who 
holds a cigarette and tobacco products distributor license may not hold a cigarette and tobacco products wholesaler license.
A “wholesaler” is any person, other than a licensed distributor, who engages in this 
state in making sales for resale of tax-paid (stamped) cigarettes and/or tax-paid tobacco products (R&TC section 30016). Accordingly, a licensed distributor, by definition, is not a wholesaler, and thus may not also hold a wholesaler license. Therefore, a distributor may not register for or renew a wholesaler license, and a wholesaler may not register for or renew a distributor license. 
If you are already licensed as both a distributor and wholesaler, you may renew 
either your distributor license(s) or your wholesaler license(s), but not both types of licenses, for the upcoming calendar year 2019 license period. Each person who sells cigarettes or tobacco products is responsible for having the proper license(s) at each location where sales of these products are made (R&TC section 30140 and 30155). A letter with further details will be sent to the affected licensees.
For more information regarding cigarette and tobacco products tax and licensing, see 
our online Tax Guide for Cigarette and Tobacco Products at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/ 
cigarette-and-tobacco-products.htm, or call the Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711), Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays. From the main menu, select the option, Special Taxes and Fees.

New Cannabis Taxes Begin January 1, 20 18
If you sell cannabis or cannabis products, you must register with the California Department of Tax and Fee 
Administration (CDT FA) for a seller’s permit. Cannabis cultivators, processors, manufacturers, retailers, microbusinesses, 
and distributors making sales are required to obtain and maintain a seller’s permit as a prerequisite for applying for a 
license with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, the California Department of Consumer Affairs, or the 
California Department of Public Health.
Distributors of cannabis and cannabis products must also register with the CDT FA for a cannabis tax permit to report and 
pay the two new cannabis taxes to the CDT FA. The cannabis tax permit is in addition to your seller’s permit. 
Beginning January 1, 2018, two new cannabis taxes are in effect: 
•
A 15 percent excise tax is imposed upon purchasers of cannabis and cannabis products. Retailers are required to collect
the excise tax from the purchaser and pay it to the cannabis distributor.
• A tax on the cultivation of cannabis that enters the commercial market is imposed upon cultivators. Cultivators
are required to pay the cultivation tax to either a distributor or a manufacturer depending upon the nature of thetransaction. The cultivation tax rates are:
• $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers, and
• $
2.75 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis leaves.
 Additional categories and rates may be specified at a later date.
All cannabis businesses making sales are required to: 
• Register online with the CDTFA for a seller’s permit.
•  File sales and use tax returns electronically and pay any sales and use tax to the CDTFA. Even if none of your sales are
subject to sales tax, you are still required to file a return and report your activities on your return to the CDTFA.
In addition, if you are a cannabis distributor, the following requirements apply to you:
• Prior to January 1, 2018, register online with the CDTFA for a cannabis tax permit. (Registration will be available in
November 2017.)
• Beginning January 1, 2018, collect the excise tax from retailers you supply.•  Beginning January 1, 2018, collect the cultivation tax from cultivators or manufacturers that send or transfer cannabis
and cannabis products to you.
• File both your cannabis tax and  sales and use tax returns electronically and pay any tax amounts due to the CDTFA.

Cannabis - What You Need to Know about
the Tax Rates and Registration
Beginning January 1, 2018, harvested cannabis is subject to a cultivation tax and both cannabis and cannabis products are 
subject to a cannabis excise tax. As a cannabis business, it is important you are aware of the new tax rates, how these taxes apply to your business activities, and your registration requirements. 
What are the cultivation tax rates and who pays the tax? 
The current cultivation tax rates are: • $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers, and • $2.75 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis leaves.
Additional categories and rates may be specified at a later date in regulations and will be posted on our website at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov . 
The cultivation tax applies to all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market. Cultivators are responsible for paying the cultivation tax to the distributor or to the manufacturer if the first transfer or sale of unprocessed cannabis is to a manufacturer. Manufacturers who collect the cultivation tax are required to pay the tax to the distributor. The distributor reports and pays the cultivation tax to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA).
What is the cannabis excise tax rate and who pays the tax? 
The cannabis excise tax is imposed upon purchasers of all cannabis and cannabis products at a rate of 15 percent of the average market price when purchased at retail. Retailers are responsible for collecting the cannabis excise tax from purchasers at the time of the retail sale and for paying the tax to the distributor. The distributor reports and pays the cannabis excise tax to the CDTFA.
How is the average market price determined? 
•  When the sale to the retailer is an arm’s length transaction, meaning the consideration received reflects the fair market 
value between two parties under no requirement to participate in the transaction, the average market price is the 
wholesale cost  of the cannabis or cannabis products sold or transferred to the retailer, plus a mark-up  predetermined by 
the CDTFA (see heading below).
 º  The wholesale cost is the amount paid by the retailer for the cannabis or cannabis products, including transportation 
charges and adding back in any discounts or trade allowances. In an arm’s length transaction, the excise tax is not based on the retailer’s gross receipts.
•  When the sale or transaction is not  at arm’s length, the average market price is the cannabis retailer’s gross receipts from 
the retail sale of the cannabis or cannabis products.
What is the mark-up rate on wholesale cost? The current mark-up rate as set by the CDTFA is 60 percent for all cannabis and cannabis products.
CDTFA is required to determine the mark-up rate every six months. The rate will be posted on our website at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov . 
CANNABIS
SPECIAL NOTICECalifornia Department of Tax and Fee AdministrationHow does the distributor report and pay cultivation and cannabis excise taxes to the CDTFA? 
•  Distributors must register with the CDTFA for a cannabis tax permit to report and pay the cultivation tax and cannabis 
excise tax to the CDTFA.
•  A microbusiness licensee is licensed to act as a distributor, among other things, and must comply with all the same 
requirements as a distributor.
How does sales and use tax apply? •  Sales and use tax applies to retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products, but does not apply to sales of medicinal 
cannabis and cannabis products where a purchaser provides his/her Medical Marijuana Identification Card issued by the California Department of Public Health and a valid government identification card. 
•  Gross receipts from the sale of cannabis and cannabis products for purposes of sales and use tax include  
the excise tax.
•  Cannabis retailers, cultivators, manufacturers, and distributors making sales must register with the CDTFA for a seller’s 
permit to report and pay any sales and use tax due to the CDTFA. If you already have a seller’s permit that was issued by the Board of Equalization (BOE), it is not necessary to re-register for a seller’s permit with the CDTFA.
•  It is important that you timely obtain a valid resale certificate that is accepted in good faith from the purchaser if you 
make sales for resale. 
• Current sales and use tax rates can be found on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov . 
When may I register my cannabis business? Beginning November 20, 2017, you can register for all the proper tax permits for your cannabis business on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov . From the CDTFA homepage, click the Register link, and follow the prompt. When registering your 
business activity, make sure to select box number 3, Cannabis business activities . 
Where can I get more information? The information provided here is general. The tax law can be complicated and there are very specific requirements for the cannabis industry. Read our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm  for 
helpful information on a variety of topics including: registration, invoice requirements, tax exemptions, recordkeeping, calculation of the tax due with examples, and other important resources.
If you have additional questions, you may call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711) Monday through 
Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.

711Renewable Fuel Registration and Reporting 
Requirements for the Oil Spill Prevention and 
Administration Fee
Beginning January 1, 2022, the oil spill prevention and administration (OSPA) fee will apply 
to renewable fuel received at marine terminals, refineries, and at two new facility types. The changes discussed in this notice are due to the enactment of Assembly Bill 148  
(Stats. 2021, ch. 115).
New registration requirement
Two new facility types must register with us for the OSPA fee:
• Renewable fuel production facility  – a facility that produces renewable fuel for blending 
or shipment.
• Renewable fuel receiving facility – a facility that is the first point of receipt in California for 
renewable fuel that originated from outside California.
How to register
You may register with us online starting November 1, 2021, by visiting our website  and 
selecting the Login/Register  button to begin the process.
Already registered with us for the OSPA fee?You will be able to add new facility types(s), as defined in Revenue and Taxation Code 
section  46024 , to your account when you file your OSPA fee return starting November 2021.
How does the fee apply to renewable fuel?
Beginning January 1, 2022, the fee will be imposed on owners of renewable fuel when:
• The renewable fuel is received at:
 ○A marine terminal or refinery, whether it is from within or outside California.
 ○A renewable fuel receiving facility when it is from outside California.
• The renewable fuel is shipped from a renewable fuel production facility within California.
The operator of the marine terminal, refinery, renewable fuel receiving facility, or renewable 
fuel production facility must collect the fee from the owner, file monthly returns online, and pay the fee to us.
What is renewable fuel?
Effective July 22, 2021, renewable fuel  means any liquid produced from nonpetroleum 
renewable resources that is used or useable as a fuel, or such liquid that may be blended 
with other types of fuels. Renewable fuel  includes fuels that may contain up to five percent 
petroleum products, such as, denatured ethanol. 
Renewable fuel receipts between July 22, 2021, through December 31, 2021
Although the definition of renewable fuel became effective July 22, 2021, renewable fuel 
received from July 22, 2021, through December 31, 2021, is not subject to the OSPA fee.OCTOBER 2021

The Mexican Merchant Program Ended on December 31, 2020
Beginning January 1, 2021, Mexican merchants no longer need to register with the California 
Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) for the Mexican Merchant Program. Instead, they should provide a California seller with a resale certificate ( CDTFA-230 , General Resale Certificate
i)
when purchasing merchandise for resale. The Mexican Merchant Program was created several years ago to provide an easy way for Mexican merchants to purchase items for resale from California vendors, and for those vendors to support claimed nontaxable sales for resale. However, the program was duplicative of our existing process for documenting sales for resale. 
Starting January 1, 2021, California vendors should obtain from Mexican merchants the same kind 
of resale certificate with supporting documentation, as described in Regulation 1668 , Sales for 
Resale , that they would from any other purchaser that intends to resell the property purchased. If 
the sale to a purchaser from Mexico does not qualify as a nontaxable sale for resale, it may still qualify as a tax-exempt export to a foreign country, as explained in Regulation 1620 , Interstate and 
Foreign Commerce . Mexican retailers should experience no change in the application of tax to their 
transactions, and both regulations above can be found on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.go v.
For more information  
If you have any questions regarding this change, please contact our Customer Service Center at 
1-800-400-7115 (CRS:711). Customer service representatives are available Monday through Friday
from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.

Cannabis Trade Samples Exempt from Cannabis Taxes
A new California law allows certain cannabis licensees to provide cannabis trade samples to other licensees for 
targeted advertising of cannabis or cannabis products. Cannabis or cannabis products provided to other cannabis licensees as trade samples are exempt from the cultivation tax and the cannabis excise tax (see Assembly Bill 141 ). 
What taxes are exempt on cannabis trade samples?
• On and after January 1, 2022, the cultivation tax  will not apply to harvested cannabis that will be, or has been, 
designated a trade sample and harvested cannabis used to manufacture cannabis products designated as trade samples and given to other licensees for no cost or consideration .
• Effective September 29, 2021, the cannabis excise tax  does not  apply to cannabis or cannabis products 
provided to other licensees when the products are designated as trade samples and not sold to other licensees or consumers.
When are taxes due on cannabis trade samples?
• The cultivation tax  collected from a cultivator on cannabis later designated as a trade sample must be returned 
to that cultivator. If the collected cultivation tax cannot be returned to the cultivator, the amount collected must be paid to us by the distributor performing the required quality assurance review once the cannabis or cannabis products pass the required testing. 
• A cannabis licensee that receives cannabis or cannabis products as a trade sample, and later sells the cannabis or cannabis products, is liable for the cannabis excise tax  and the cultivation tax  that applies to the 
cannabis or cannabis products sold. 
• A cannabis licensee that sells cannabis trade samples in a retail sale is liable for the sales tax  that applies to 
the cannabis or cannabis products sold as a trade sample.
What documentation is needed?
Each licensee providing or receiving trade samples should keep documentation to support that the cannabis or cannabis products are designated as trade samples and were given to or received by another licensee without payment or consideration. Without proper documentation, a cannabis licensee may be liable for all applicable taxes that would otherwise be due if the cannabis or cannabis products were sold.
Your documentation should include the following:
• A statement indicating the cultivation tax or the cannabis excise tax was not collected or paid.
• Any information on the licensee providing the trade samples, the licensee receiving the trade samples, and the 
licensee transporting the trade samples.
• This documentation should be consistent with the transaction(s) recorded in the California Cannabis Track-and-Trace System.
• Examples of documentation include a letter, invoice, note, or preprinted form.• A cannabis licensee may use CDTFA-230-CD, Cannabis Tax Exemption Certificate, as written certification that 
the cannabis or cannabis products were given and used as trade samples. The CDTFA-230-CD is available on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/DownloadFile.ashx?path=/formspubs/cdtfa230cd.pdf . 
The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) is responsible for regulating cannabis trade samples. For information on these requirements, please visit the DCC website at https://cannabis.ca.gov .

We encourage you to read our online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm .

Page 1New Responsibilities for Cannabis Retailers  
Beginning January 1, 2023
Beginning January 1, 2023, the responsibility for collecting and paying the cannabis excise tax to the California 
Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) shifts from distributors to cannabis retailers.
Obtain a cannabis retailer excise tax account
In December 2022, we will automatically register cannabis retailers and microbusinesses who sell cannabis or cannabis products at retail with a cannabis retailer excise tax account based on their licensing information with the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC). 
• We will notify the cannabis retailers that are automatically registered.
• Cannabis retailers that are not automatically registered must register with us for a cannabis retailer excise tax account through our 
online services , which will be available in late December 2022. 
• The cannabis retailer excise tax account is required in addition to the retailer’s sales and use tax account.
Collect the cannabis excise tax
Beginning January 1, 2023, cannabis retailers are responsible for collecting the 15 percent cannabis excise tax from purchasers based on gross receipts from the retail sale of cannabis or cannabis products. 
• Gross receipts include the sales price of the cannabis or cannabis products and all charges related to the sale, such as delivery fees and any local cannabis taxes listed separately on the invoice or receipt provided to the purchaser. 
• Gross receipts for cannabis excise tax purposes do not include sales tax or the gross receipts from the retail sale of any noncannabis item.
• The cannabis excise tax must be listed separately on the receipt or invoice provided to the retail purchaser and included in gross receipts subject to sales and use tax. 
For an example on how the cannabis excise tax will be calculated, please see our Tax Guide for Cannabis 
Businesses  under the Retailers  tab at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm . 
Report and pay the cannabis excise tax
Cannabis retailers must file cannabis retailer excise tax returns online and pay the cannabis excise tax collected from purchasers to us. New cannabis retailer excise tax accounts will be assigned to a quarterly reporting basis, due and payable on or before the last day of the month following each quarterly period.
• The first cannabis retailer excise tax return will be due May 1, 2023, for the January 1, 2023, through  
March 31, 2023, quarterly reporting period. L-874 (10-22) Page 2•Cannabis retailers may claim a credit on their cannabis retailer excise tax return for any cannabis excise tax
paid to a distributor for cannabis or cannabis products purchased before January 1, 2023, and sold at retail onand after January 1, 2023. Any amount of cannabis excise tax due to a distributor for purchases made prior toJanuary 1, 2023, must be paid to the distributor no later than April 1, 2023.
•Cannabis retailers must keep documentation to support any credits reported on their cannabis retailer excisetax return. Without proper documentation, the claimed credit may be disallowed. We may hold the cannabisretailer liable for any unpaid cannabis excise tax. Documentation may include, but is not limited to:
•Sales invoice or receipt indicating cannabis or cannabis products sold in a retail sale on or after
January 1, 2023.
•Purchase invoice or manifest indicating the cannabis or cannabis products that were sold in a retail sale onor after January 1, 2023, were sold or transferred by a distributor to the cannabis retailer prior to
January 1, 2023.
•Other information supporting the payment of the cannabis excise tax to a distributor for cannabis orcannabis products purchased from the distributor prior to January 1, 2023, and sold at retail on and afterJanuary 1, 2023.
•Certain retailers who are already approved for a license fee waiver with DCC, can apply with us to retain
20 percent of the cannabis excise tax due as vendor compensation. Information on how to apply for and reportvendor compensation will be provided in a special notice and on our 
Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  in
December 2022.
•Additional information on how to file a cannabis retailer excise tax return will be provided on our Tax Guide for

711Reduced Tax Rate for Dimethyl Ether and 
Dimethyl Ether-Liquefied Petroleum Gas Blends 
Effective July 1, 2021
Effective July 1, 2021, the use fuel tax rate on dimethyl ether (DME) and dimethyl 
ether-liquefied petroleum gas (DME-LPG) fuel blends will be reduced to six cents ($.06) per gallon. This is the same rate applicable to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG.) 
The use fuel tax is imposed on the use of certain fuels in motor vehicles. Fuels subject to 
the use fuel tax are currently taxed at the base use fuel tax rate of eighteen cents ($0.18) per gallon or unit used, unless a reduced rate has been specifically identified. 
How do I report DME on my use fuel tax return?
Starting July 1, 2021, you should report all DME and DME-LPG blends in the same category as LPG on your use fuel tax return at the reduced rate of six cents ($0.06) per gallon. Transactions prior to July 1, 2021, should be reported in the Kerosene, Distillate, Stove Oil, and Other Fuels  category at the eighteen cents ($0.18) per gallon use fuel tax rate.
How do I report DME on my International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) tax return?
Starting July 1, 2021, you should report all DME and DME-LPG blends on your IFTA tax return by selecting the option, Propane,  from the Fuel Type  selection dropdown.
What is DME?
DME is a synthetically produced alternative to diesel fuel for use in specially designed compression ignition diesel engines. It is produced from a variety of feedstocks, including biogas from organic waste produced in cities or by agricultural operations, as well as natural gas. From a fuel storage and refueling perspective, DME is like LPG in that it is a gaseous fuel at normal atmospheric temperatures and pressures, but is a liquid if kept in pressurized storage at 75 pounds per square inch (psi).
Flat rate decals
Owners or operators of DME or DME-LPG blend-powered vehicles, except interstate users, may pay the flat rate fuel tax in lieu of paying the per gallon rate.
Legislation information
The rate change is due to the enactment of Assembly Bill (AB) 2663 (Stats 2020, ch. 117), which changes the use fuel tax rate of DME and DME-LPG blends from eighteen cents ($0.18) to six cents ($0.06) per gallon used, effective July 1, 2021. AB 2663 also authorizes owners or operators of DME or DME-LPG fuel blend-powered vehicles, except interstate users, to pay the flat rate fuel tax.

New Tax Rate on Tobacco Products  
Effective July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025 
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) recently approved 
the new tax rate of 52.92 percent, effective July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025. We are required to annually determine the tax rate on tobacco products (products other than cigarettes), which is equivalent to the combined rate of tax imposed on cigarettes.
How does the tax apply?
Tobacco products distributors are required to apply this rate to all distributions of tobacco products in California during the effective period. 
The tax is based on the distributor’s wholesale cost, which is the cost of the tobacco products charged to the distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances.
1 This cost 
is typically the invoiced price of the tobacco products charged by a manufacturer or importer to the licensed distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances.
When is the tax due?
The tax is due at the time the tobacco products are distributed in California. The tax rate 
that applies is the rate in effect at the time the tobacco product is sold by the distributor . 
You may find current and historical tobacco products tax rates on our website at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm .
For more information
Please visit our online Tax Guide for Cigarettes and Tobacco Products at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/

L-903 (8-23)Does Your Business Add a Surcharge?
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration is providing you with this informational letter to ensure you are correctly collecting and reporting sales and use tax (tax) on surcharges. Below is general information about the application of tax to surcharges and provides you with references to law sections, online guides, and helpful publications.
Sales and Use Tax Law in California
In California, a retailer owes tax based upon their gross receipts on retail sales (that is, sales to consumers). Gross receipts include all  amounts received with respect to a sale, with no deduction for the cost of the materials, service, or 
expense of the retailer (you) passed on to the purchaser (your customer), unless there is a specific statutory exclusion.
Surcharges Added to Taxable Sales
If you separately add a surcharge to your taxable sales, whether it be a flat fee or a percentage of the selling price, tax generally also applies to the surcharge amount. Surcharges have various titles, such as a merchant card processing fee, healthcare surcharge, COVID-19 surcharge, wage increase fee, inflation fee, tourism fee, fuel surcharge, paid sick leave fee, restaurant surcharges, or other such charges.
In the examples below, the computation of tax is based on the total taxable transaction, which includes the surcharge. The tax rate in both examples is 8.50 percent (8.50%), but your actual tax rate may differ

Example 1 Example 2
Baked pasta $ 14.00 Rental: Adult Bicycle $ 25.00
Side salad 4.00 Rental: Adult Bicycle 25.00
Wine 8.00 Rental: Child Bicycle 12.00

Tax [8.50% x $26.52] 2.25 Tax [8.50% x $63.86] 5.43
Total due $ 28.77 Total due $69.29
For more information
For more information, please see Revenue and Taxation Code sections 6012, Gross receipts2, and 6051, Imposition and 
rate of sales tax3; our Industry & Tax and Fee Guides4, and various publications, including publication 44, District Taxes

Require a Power of Attorney for Marine Agents to Act 
on Behalf of Owners and Operators 
Beginning January 1, 2022, we can disclose information regarding a vessel owner or

Agent Agreement (Agent Agreement) to authorize a marine agent to act on their behalf.  This change is due to the enactment of Senate Bill 824  (Stats. 2021, ch. 432) located at

What does this mean for marine agents?
We will send you a copy of the billing for each arrival, in which you are acting on behalf of a vessel owner or operator, based on the information we receive from the Marine Exchange.
 What does this mean for owners and operators?
• You will continue to receive the original billings as legal notification of the liability even if you use a marine agent for processing your billings. A copy of the billing will be mailed to your agent for payment.
• We will continue to bill you directly when a marine agent is not used for processing billings.

Revised Cannabis Tax Return  
Beginning with the January 2022 and First Quarter 2022 Filing Periods
Revisions to the cannabis tax return require cannabis distributors to report additional information when filing their online return beginning with the January 2022 and First Quarter 2022 filing periods. 
What’s new for reporting the cannabis excise tax?
The cannabis excise tax portion of the return will require you to separately report the average market price for 
arm’s length transactions and nonarm’s length transactions subject to the 15 percent cannabis excise tax.
•	The average market price for arm’s length transactions is the cannabis retailer’s wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products plus the CDTFA predetermined mark-up, which is currently set at 80 percent.
•	The average market price for nonarm’s length transactions is the cannabis retailer’s gross receipts from the retail sale of the cannabis or cannabis products.
What’s new for reporting the cultivation tax?
For the cultivation tax portion, the return will now have three schedules to report cannabis that entered the 
commercial market during the reporting period for each cultivation tax category: cannabis flowers, cannabis leaves, and fresh cannabis plant.
Each cultivation tax schedule will require you to report the following:
•	Total ounces of cannabis that entered the commercial market in the reporting period, including ounces of 
medicinal cannabis designated for donation and cannabis designated as trade samples.
•	Ounces of medicinal cannabis designated for donation that are included in total ounces reported, if applicable.
•	Ounces of cannabis designated as cannabis trade samples that are included in total ounces reported, if applicable.
Each schedule provides an option for you to choose a prior year to report cannabis that entered the commercial market during the reporting period for which you are filing, but the cultivation tax was collected based on a prior year’s cultivation tax rate because the cultivator sold or transferred the cannabis in a prior year.
The system will then calculate the total exempt ounces and total taxable ounces for the return to apply the 
appropriate cultivation tax rate.
How to prepare for the new return:
•	Begin determining and documenting the average market price separately for arm’s length and nonarm’s length 
transactions if you will be reporting both types of transactions.
•	Begin determining and documenting to report the total ounces of cannabis that entered the commercial market to include exempt ounces of medicinal cannabis donations and cannabis trade samples.
•	Watch our video, How to File a Cannabis Tax Return , located on our website at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm#Videos . 
For more information

New Tax Rate on Othe r T obacco Products 
Effective July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023
The California Department o f Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) recently approved 
the new tax rate of 61. 74 percent effective July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023. We are 
annually required to determine the tax rate on other tobacco products (products other than 
cigarettes), which is equivalent to the combined rate of tax imposed on cigarettes.
How does the tax apply?
Tobacco products distributors are required to apply this rate to all distributions of other 
tobacco products during the effective period . Tobacco products distributors pay this tax 
upon the distribution of tobacco products in California.
The tax is based on the distributor’s wholesale cost, which is the cost of the tobacco 
products charged to the distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances (see Revenue 
and Taxation Code section 30017  and Regulation 4076). This cost is typically the invoiced 
pr
ice of the tobacco products charged by a manufacturer or importer to the licensed 
distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances.
When is the tax due?
The tax is due at the time the tobacco products are distributed in California . The tax rate 
th
at applies is the rate in effect at the time the tobacco product is sold by the distributo r. 
Yo
u may find current and historical tobacco products tax rates on our website at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm .

L-850Reminder for Retailers  
New Tax on Electronic Cigarettes Containing or  
Sold with Nicotine
The new California electronic cigarette excise tax (CECET), effective July 1, 2022, requires 
retailers of electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine to hold a CECET permit (account) in addition to a seller’s permit and Cigarette and Tobacco Products Retailer’s License (CRL). Below are some important reminders and details: 
Requirements
Beginning July 1, 2022, electronic cigarette retailers are required to:
• Hold a CECET account prior to selling electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine to California consumers (purchasers).
• Collect the 12.5 percent CECET from purchasers on the retail selling price of electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine.
 ○The CECET is not subject to sales and use tax.
• Provide the purchaser with a receipt or other document that separately identifies the CECET and the amount the purchaser paid on each electronic cigarette retail sale.
• Include the CECET amount in any electronic cigarette price marketing sign or display.
Registration
• Beginning June 1, 2022, you may register for a CECET account using our Online Services Portal  at onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov/_/ . 
• At the end of May 2022, we registered some retailers with a CECET account based on our records and notified those registered by mail. If we have not registered you for a CECET account and you need one, you must register with us.
• If you do not sell electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine and we registered you with a CECET account in error, please contact us at the phone number below under For More Information,  to update your business account information.
CECET Return and Payment Due Dates
• The CECET returns and payments are due on a quarterly basis by the due date. 
• The due date is on or before the last day of the month following each calendar quarter period.
• The first return and payment are due by October 31, 2022, for the period July 1, 2022, through September 30, 2022. 
• The return must be filed electronically using our Online Services Portal at  
onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov/_/ .
• If you did not make any sales during a reporting period, you must file a zero return timely.
• The return and payment must be submitted separately from other returns and reports. 
• A one percent reimbursement of the CECET is automatically calculated when you file your CECET return. For example, if your CECET is $12,500 ($100,000 sales x 0.125 CECET rate), the one percent reimbursement is $125 ($12,500 x 0.01 reimbursement rate).Page 2CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

The emergency Regulation 3702 is now in effect. 
The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulations and Safety Act and regulations adopted by the Bureau of Cannabis

California Cigarette Tax Stamps Purchased Before March 17, 2020, Are Expiring – Claims for Refund Are Now Being Accepted
There are two versions of red-orange California cigarette tax stamps in 
circulation. Stamps sold before March 17, 2020, will expire in early 2023. Cigarette distributors who purchased these stamps on a cash basis have until March 16, 2023, to file a claim for refund. Distributors who purchased these stamps on a deferred payment basis have until April 25, 2023, to file a claim for refund. We will not accept refund claims for the expiring stamps after these dates.

onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov .  For claims for refund involving 
cigarettes from multiple manufacturers, a separate claim must be filed for each manufacturer.
The current and expiring stamps look very similar. The easiest way to identify the expiring stamps is to look at the color on the left side of the stamps. 
Expiring Stamps
• The color on the left side of the expiring stamps is darker than on thecurrent stamp.
•  The star on the left side of the expiring stamp has a thinner white border,and two of the star points are cut off.
•  There is a larger gap between the star and the letters “CA” on the expiringstamps.
Current Stamps
•The color of the left side on the current stamp is lighter.
• The star on the left side of the current stamp has a thicker white border,and only one star point is cut off.
•The star is set close to the letters “CA.”

New 988 Surcharge Effective  
January 1, 2023
Starting January 1, 2023, telecommunication service suppliers 
and sellers of prepaid mobile telephony services (MTS) are required to report a new 988 surcharge when filing the Emergency Telephone User Surcharge Return or Prepaid MTS Return .
The new legislation:
• Establishes a new 988 State Suicide and Behavioral HealthCrisis Services Fund.
• Imposes the 988 surcharge on each access line for eachmonth or partial month for which a service user subscribeswith a service supplier and each retail purchase of prepaidMTS in California.
• Sets the 988 surcharge at $0.08 per access line or purchaseof prepaid MTS for calendar years 2023 and 2024.
o This surcharge will be reported on the same return as the
911 surcharge.

For more information, please see Assembly Bill (AB) 988  (Stats. 
2022, ch. 747).New Billing Process for Delinquent 
Returns 
In July 2022, we implemented a new automated billing process 
for taxpayers that do not file timely returns. Taxpayers receive a reminder to 
file before and after the due date of their return. The 
reminders may be in the form of an email, a notice, a text message, or a telephone call. If taxpayers do not file the return, they will first receive a Notice of Delinquency, and then an estimated billing notice, called a Notice of Proposed Assessment Liability, outlining the proposed amount to be billed. Thirty days after the Notice of Proposed Assessment Liability is sent, the proposed amount will be billed and enter our collection process. This billing can easily be avoided by timely filing your clients’ returns or promptly closing their seller’s permit when their business operations end.
Returns can be filed online at any time. If taxpayers cannot pay the amount due, they can request a 
payment plan  using our  
online services  after they log in with their username and password.Online Webinars and Video Tutorial

This guide will be updated as more information becomes available 
– please c heck back p eriodically f or updates.Sales and Use Tax for Nonprofit 
Organizations
Although many nonprofit organizations are exempt from federal  
and state income tax, there  is no similar exemption from California 
sales and use tax. Generally,  a nonprofit’s sales and purchases  
are taxable. In other words,  nonprofit organizations, in general, are 
treated just like other California sellers and buyers for sales and use 
tax purposes.
However, there are exemptions  available for certain  nonprofit 
organizations. Examples of nonprofit organizations that have 
specific sales and use tax  exemptions can be found in publication 
18. How tax applies to sales by a  certain nonprofit organization
is fact-specific and depends  on the type of organization and the 
organization’s practices and activities. For example,  some nonprofit 
organizations may qualify for special exemptions from sales  or use 
tax on meals and food products that are delivered to the elderly and 
people with disabilities while  others are afforded an exemption on 
items sold, such as military  welfare society thrift stores.
For more information on nonprofit organizations and available 
exemptions, please see publication 18, Nonprofit O rganizations , at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/form spubs/pu b18.pdf , publication 262, Tax Help 
for N onprofit an d Faith-Based Or ganizations , at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/pub262g.pd f, and our Tax Guide for  
Nonprofit O rganizations , at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/nonprofit-organizations.htm#Overvie w, 
available on our website.
Military Thrift Stores
The exemption from tax on sales made by military welfare society 
thrift stores was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023, but 
has now been made permanent. As a result of this exemption, 
tax does not apply to sales by a thrift store located on a military 
installation and operated by an entity that partners with the United 
States Department of Defense to provide financial, educational, 
and other assistance to members of the Armed Forces of the 
United States, eligible family members, and survivors that are in 
need (see SB  1041 [Stats. 2022, ch. 225]).
New Law Prohibits Retail Sales of 
Menthol Cigarettes and Most Flavored 
Tobacco Produ cts
Beginning December 21, 2022, cigarette and tobacco products 
retailers may no longer sell, offer, or possess with the intent to sell, 
menthol cigarettes and most flavored tobacco products. The law 
does not apply to flavored premium cigars with a wholesale price 
(retailer’s purchase price) of $12 or more and flavored loose-leaf 
pipe tobacco. Flavored shisha or hookah tobacco may be sold 
in licensed retail stores that only admit persons 21 years or older 
and operate following all state and/or local laws. Please visit the 
California Department of Public Health’s website for frequently 
asked questions, a fact sheet, and other useful resources. 
For more information, please read SB 7 93 (Stats. 2020, ch. 34), 
which was upheld by the passage of Proposition 31 and added the 
flavored t obacco s ale p rohibition section 104559.5 to the Health 
and Safety Code , and our special notice, New Law Prohibits Retail

New Program for Lithium Producers 
Beginning January 1, 2023
Beginning January 1, 2023, any person (producer) extracting 
lithium from a naturally occurring substance such as geothermal fluid, spodumene ore, rock, minerals, or clay, must pay a lithium extraction excise tax. The new tax is based upon the lifetime cumulative amount of metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent extracted in California and each producer must register for a lithium excise tax (LET) permit with us.
If your client plans to extract lithium in California in 2023, we will help them register for their LET permit. Please contact us at 1-800-400-7115 (CRS:711), then select the Special Taxes and Fees  option. Customer service representatives are available 
Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.
For more information, please visit our Lithium Extraction Excise Tax Guide , at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/lithium-
extraction-excise-tax.htm . We will update this guide as more 
information becomes available – please check back periodically for updates.Staying In Compliance
Misclassifying workers can be costly to a business, so it pays to stay in compliance. If worker misclassification is discovered during an audit, the business is responsible for unpaid Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Training Tax, worker contributions not properly withheld, and the interest from when those contributions were legally due, until paid. The business may also be subject to penalties on the amount due. Misclassification also affects workers, as it impacts their ability to access vital resources to which they are entitled, such as UI, Disability Insurance (DI), and Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits. The 
Employment Development Department  (EDD) provides vital 
resources for businesses to stay informed on the current law. 
ABC Test
Beginning January 1, 2020, section 2775 was added to the Labor Code and amended section 621(b) of the California Unemployment Insurance Code (CUIC) by removing the “common law rules” and applying the ABC test. Under the ABC test, an individual providing labor or services for remuneration is presumed to be an employee rather than an independent contractor unless the hiring entity demonstrates certain conditions apply. While the ABC test is the applicable test for most workers, sections 2776 through 2784 of the Labor Code establish exceptions to the ABC test for some workers, occupations, and contracting relationships. For more information about the ABC test and a full list of the ABC test exceptions, please see 
AB 5  (Stats. 2019, ch. 296) and visit the California 
Labor & Workforce Development Agency’s Employment Status Portal, at 
www.labor.ca.gov/employmentstatus .Education and Outreach

L-907Rate Change for International Fuel Tax Agreement 
and Interstate User Diesel Fuel Tax Licensees
Effective July 1, 2023
The tax rate you report and pay with your quarterly International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) 
or Interstate User Diesel Fuel tax return for diesel fuel purchased outside California and used in California is changing twice this year. It will increase from 85.3 cents ($0.853) to 89.3 cents ($0.893) per gallon on July 1, 2023. Then, on October 1, 2023, it will increase again from 89.3 cents ($0.893) to 1.089 dollars ($1.089) per gallon.
What is included in the tax rate?
The tax rate includes both diesel fuel tax and excise tax. Current law provides for a partial sales and use tax exemption (3.9375%) for sales of diesel fuel from October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023. Therefore, diesel fuel will have one excise tax rate ($0.452) for the period of July 1, 2023, through September 30, 2023, that accounts for the partial exemption and another rate ($0.648) from October 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024, based on the full sales and use tax rate on diesel fuel.
July 1, 2023, through 
September 30, 2023October 1, 2023, through 
June 30, 2024
Total 89.3 cents ($0.893) 1.089 dollars ($1.089)
Diesel Fuel Tax * 44.1 cents ($0.441) 44.1 cents ($0.441)
Excise Tax 45.2 cents ($0.452) 64.8 cents ($0.648)
*  Diesel fuel tax rate is adjusted on July 1 of each year.
When are these new tax rates in effect?
These new rates are in effect from July 1, 2023, through September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024, as shown above. You must use these rates starting with your third quarter 2023 return (July 1, 2023, through September 30, 2023).
How do I report my tax-paid diesel fuel?
You must file your quarterly tax return and report the gallons of tax-paid diesel fuel you used in each state. Beginning July 1, 2023, you may claim a credit of 89.3 cents ($0.893) per gallon for tax-paid diesel fuel that you purchased in California and used both inside and outside California. Then, beginning October 1, 2023, you may claim a credit of 1.089 cents ($1.089) per gallon for tax-paid diesel fuel that you purchased in California and used both inside and outside California.

Refunds of excess tax or fee reimbursement
Excess Tax Reimbursement Defined  
When an amount represented by a person to a customer as constituting reimbursement for taxes or fees is computed on an amount that is not taxable or exceeds the taxable amount and is actually paid by the customer to the person, that amount is excess tax reimbursement. Excess tax reimbursement is collected when: 
• Reimbursement is computed on a trasaction which is not subject to tax
• Reimbursement is computed on an amount in excess of the amount subject to tax
• Reimbursement is computed using a tax rate higher than the rate imposed by law
Whenever you have collected excess tax reimbursement, you will have to refund the excess collections to the customers from whom they were collected; otherwise, any excess tax or fee reimbursement must be paid to the state.
You should retain evidence of the refund to each customer by records which can be verified by audit, such as:
• Receipts or cancelled checks.
• Books of account showing that credit has been granted to the customer as an offset against an existing indebtedness owed by 
the customer to the person.NEED MORE INFORMATION?

CANNABIS
TAX FACTCalifornia Department of Tax and Fee Administration
Information for Cannabis Retailers  
Excise Tax on Cannabis Purchased before January 1, 2018
New cannabis taxes are now in effect in California. We developed a series of “Cannabis Tax Fact” messages to provide 
information on specific topics to help you understand your cannabis excise tax and sales and use tax responsibilities. Today’s topic for cannabis retailers is:
How to calculate and pay the cannabis excise tax on cannabis products acquired prior to,
and sold at retail after January 1, 2018
As you know, beginning January 1, 2018, licensed distributors who supply you with cannabis or cannabis products are required to calculate and collect the 15 percent cannabis excise tax from you. When you sell those items at retail you are required to collect the cannabis excise tax from your customer.
If you had cannabis or cannabis products in your inventory on January 1, 2018, you are required to collect the 15 percent 
cannabis excise tax from your customer when you sell those items and then pay that amount to a licensed distributor with whom you have established a business relationship. 
To collect the excise tax from your customers, apply the 15 percent excise tax to the “average market price.” The average 
market price can be calculated as either: 
    1. Your gross receipts, which is the retail selling price to your customer, or    2.  Your wholesale cost plus a markup predetermined by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration 
(CDTFA)*.
The examples below illustrate the two methods to calculate the average market price and apply the 15 percent excise tax on 
your sale to your customer. Both examples assume that your retail selling price to your customer is $100 and the sales tax rate is 8 percent (your actual sales tax rate may be different): 
Example # 1 - Based on your gross receipts:
    Retail selling price   $100.00    15% excise tax ($100 x 15%)   $   15.00    Total gross receipts ($100 + $15) $115.00    8% sales tax ($115 x 8%)   $    9.20
    Total amount due ($115 + $9.20) $124.20
You must pay the $15.00 excise tax collected from your customer to a licensed distributor with whom you have a business 
relationship. The sales tax is due on your total gross receipts, which includes  the excise tax. You must report and pay the 
$9.20 in sales tax on the quarterly sales and use tax return you file with the CDTFA. 
Example #2 - Based on your wholesale cost plus a markup predetermined by the CDTFA* currently set at 60 percent. 
    Your wholesale cost    $  75.00    60% current markup ($75 x 60%) $  45.00
    Average market price ($75 + $45) $120.00    15% Excise tax due ($120 x 15%) $  18.00L-537 (3-18)You must pay the $18.00 excise tax collected from your customer to a licensed distributor with whom you have a 
business relationship. 
The sales tax is a separate computation as follows:
    Retail selling price, including excise tax ($100 + $18) $118.00    8% sales tax ($118 x 8%)    $    9.44
    Total amount due     $127.44
The sales tax is due on you your total gross receipts, which includes  the excise tax. You must report and pay the $9.44 
in sales tax on your quarterly sales and use tax return you file with the CDTFA. When invoicing your customer, you are required to add the following statement on the invoice or receipt to your 
customer, “The excise taxes are included in the total amount of this invoice.” 
Regardless of which method you choose, you must pay the excise tax you collect to a licensed cannabis distributor by 
the fifteenth of the month following the date you collected the excise tax from your customer. Make sure you receive a receipt from the licensed distributor showing the amount of excise tax you collected and paid to the licensed distributor. 
This notice is intended to give you an overview of some of the requirements for cannabis retailers and does not address 
all requirements for the cannabis industry. We encourage you to read our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm  or contact us.
In the future, these Cannabis Tax Facts will be sent via email only. If you would like to continue receiving the Cannabis Tax Facts , please sign up to our Cannabis Outreach email listserv on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/subscribe/
cannabis.asp x. Or you may update your account with a valid email address by calling our Customer Service Center at 
1-800-400-7115 (TTY: 711) Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.
* Please note:  The markup rate percentage is used to calculate average market price for excise tax calculation purposes 
and is not  meant to be used to determine the markup on your product that you sell to your customers. This markup rate 
is determined by the CDTFA every six months. For current markup rates, visit the Special Taxes and Fee s page at www.

711 Relief May Be Available to Marketplace Sellers Using 
Fulfillment Centers in California 
If you are an out-of-state retailer (marketplace seller) that is or was “engaged in business” 
in California solely because you used a marketplace facilitator to facilitate sales of your merchandise for delivery in this state, and the marketplace facilitator stored your inventory in California, you may be a “qualifying retailer” and entitled to reduced liability for certain taxes, penalties, and interest. California recently passed legislation that prohibits the CDTFA from assessing sales and use taxes on sales made by a “qualifying retailer” prior to April 1, 2016, and requires the CDTFA to relieve any penalties imposed on a “qualifying retailer” with respect to sales made for the period April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2019. 
Who is a “qualifying retailer”? 
Effective June 27, 2019, you are a “qualifying retailer” per Revenue and Taxation Code 
section 6487.07 if you meet all  of the following conditions: 
• You did not register with the CDTFA under the Sales and Use Tax Law prior to December 1, 2018. 
• You did not fle sales or use tax returns, or make sales or use tax payments prior to being contacted by the CDTFA. 
• You voluntarily register with the CDTFA, and by September 25, 2019 , fle completed 
tax returns for all tax reporting periods for which a determination may be issued under section 6487.07 (that is, for periods on and after April 1, 2016), and either 
Pay the tax due in full, or 
Apply for a payment plan, but only if the fnal payment under the plan is paid no later than December 31, 2021 (qualifying installment payment agreement). 
• You are or were engaged in business in this state solely because you used a marketplace facilitator (as defned in section 6041
1) to facilitate sales for delivery in 
this state and  the marketplace facilitator stored your inventory in this state. 
A “qualifying retailer” will not be assessed tax by the CDTFA with respect to sales made prior to April 1, 2016, and will be relieved of penalties with respect to sales made for the period April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2019. 
How do I register? 
To register, go to www.cdtfa.ca.gov  and select Register , then select Register a New 
Business Activity or Location . The start date on your account should refect the date you 
began engaging in business in California. 
1 Revenue and Taxation Code section 6041 defnes a “marketplace facilitator” as a person who contracts with 
marketplace sellers to facilitate, for consideration, the sale of the marketplace seller’s products through a 
marketplace (for example, an Internet website, dedicated sales software application, catalog, etc.) operated by the person or a related person and who engages in specifed activities.

JUNE 2022  
L-854New Tax and Reporting Requirements for 
Out-of-State Retailers of Electronic Cigarettes
Beginning July 1, 2022, electronic cigarette retailers are required to collect from California 
purchasers (consumers) a 12.5 percent California electronic cigarette excise tax (CECET) on the retail selling price of electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine for use in California. 
Do you make retail sales to California consumers?
If you sell electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine directly to California consumers from outside of California, you are considered an out-of-state retailer and a delivery seller ( Revenue and Taxation Code section 30101.7 ) and you should already have 
a cigarette and tobacco products distributor license and tobacco products distributor account with us. However, you now also need a CECET account. Out-of-state retailers are required to collect the CECET from California consumers, file a CECET return electronically, and pay the CECET to us.
What you must do starting July 1, 2022 
• Collect the CECET from California consumers at the time you sell electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine to California consumers. 
 ○The CECET is not subject to sales and use tax. Sales and use tax only applies to the selling price of the electronic cigarettes, excluding the CECET. Please see our Tax Guide for California Electronic Cigarette Excise Ta x
1 for examples of how these 
taxes apply.
• Provide your California consumer with a receipt or other document that separately identifies the CECET and the amount the California consumer paid for each electronic cigarette retail sale.
• Include the CECET amount in any electronic cigarette price marketing sign or display. This includes any type of electronic or print media marketing, including but not limited to, websites, emails, videos, mail, or magazines. 
Reporting requirements
• File CECET returns and pay the tax using our Online Services  on a quarterly basis by the 
due date. Your due date is on or before the last day of the month following each calendar 
quarter period. 
 ○The first CECET return and tax payment are due by October 31, 2022, for the period 
July 1, 2022, through September 30, 2022. 
 ○If you did not make any sales during a reporting period, you are still required to file a zero return timely.
• A one-percent reimbursement of the CECET will automatically be calculated when you file your CECET return.
Registration
Please note:  Even though registration may occur prior to September 1, 2022, you must still 
collect the CECET beginning July 1, 2022.

If you do not receive our notification letter indicating we have registered you with a CECET account and you need a CECET account, please contact us and we will register you. 
Beginning September 1, 2022, you may register for a CECET account using our 
Online Services  at onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov/_/ . You may also use our online services 
to register for a seller’s permit, cigarette and tobacco products distributor licenses, and tobacco products distributor accounts. 
What are electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine? 
• Any device or delivery system used to deliver aerosolized or vaporized nicotine to a person when sold in combination with any liquid or substance containing nicotine. Examples include: eCigarettes, eCigars, ePipes, vape pens, and eHookahs. 
• Any component, part, or accessory that is used during the operation of the device or delivery system when sold in combination with any liquid or substance containing nicotine. 
• A liquid or substance containing nicotine, such as eJuice or eLiquid, whether sold separately or sold in combination with any device.
Legislation information 
Senate Bill 3952 (Stats. 2021, ch. 489) enacted the Healthy Outcomes and Prevention 
Education (HOPE) Act, which imposes upon purchasers the California electronic cigarette excise tax on the purchase for use in California of electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine.

New Tax Rate on Other Tobacco Products  
Effective July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) recently approved 
the new tax rate of 56.93 percent effective July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021. Tobacco products distributors are required to apply this rate to all distributions of other tobacco products (products other than cigarettes) during the effective period.
Annually, the CDTFA is required to determine and impose a tax rate on other 
tobacco products that is equivalent to the combined rate of taxes imposed on cigarettes. Tobacco products distributors pay this tax upon the distribution of tobacco products in California.
The tobacco products tax is due at the time the tobacco products are distributed 
in California and is based on the distributor’s wholesale cost, the cost of the tobacco products to the distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances (see Revenue and Taxation Code section 30017 and Regulation 4076 ). Accordingly, the 
applicable tax rate is the rate in effect at the time the tobacco product is sold by the distributor.  You may find current and historical tobacco products tax rates on our 
website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm .
For more information regarding cigarette and tobacco products taxes, see our online Tax Guide for Cigarettes and Tobacco Products  at

Effective May 2020 Filing Period 
Your Cigarette Manufacturer’s Tax Return  will be revised to include the uniformity reporting 
standards established by industry and the Federation of Tax Administrators’ (FTA) 
guidelines. These reporting standards make it easy to fle tax reports in multiple states. To 
help you prepare, here are some important details about how your cigarette reporting with 
the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) will change. 
Uniformity Updates 
Your cigarette tax return and schedule will include the following updates to incorporate the 
common defnitions and guidelines set up by the FTA to standardize cigarette reporting. The 
following changes become effective for transactions taking place during the May 2020 fling 
period, due on June 25, 2020:

• Distributions will be reported on a single line. You will no longer need to separately 
report samples to the U.S. government. 
CDTFA-810-CTF , Cigarette Tax Disbursement Schedule

fle (FLT) or Extensible Markup Language (XML) format; all felds will be required. 
• Additional schedule information is listed below. 
Schedule  Code: You will have one Schedule Code (2C) to report products 
disbursed. 
Tax Jurisdiction Codes (TJCs): you will identify certain transactions using TJCs. 
See How to Prepare  below. 
• For example, we currently ask that you identify disbursements to California 
distributors using Schedule Code (6A). These will now be reported as Schedule 
Code (2C) and TJC (6A). 
Manufacturer  Name: you will need to provide the manufacturer’s company name 
for all the products you report. 
MSA  (Master Settlement Agreement) Status: you will need to identify whether the 
manufacturer is a participating or non-participating manufacturer. 
• More information on the MSA can be found in publication 407 on our website at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/pub-407.pdf .

New Proposed Cultivation Tax Category, Tax Application, 
and Invoicing Requirements for Cannabis Businesses
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) wants to ensure you are informed regarding the 
taxation requirements for the cannabis industry. The CDTFA is proposing a new category and rate for the cannabis cultivation tax. The CDTFA has included this category and rate in proposed emergency Regulation 3700. This category and rate are subject to change until approved by the Office of Administrative Law. Once approved, the rate will take effect January 1, 2018, along with the other existing cultivation tax rates. The cannabis excise tax application to inventory retailers purchased prior to January 1, 2018, and invoicing requirements are also covered below.
New proposed category and rate for the cannabis cultivation tax
Proposition 64, which was approved by voters on November 8, 2016, established a cultivation tax based on the dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers and leaves. The CDTFA has proposed a new cannabis cultivation tax category for 
fresh cannabis plants at a rate of $1.29 per ounce. The cultivation tax rates are:
• $9.25 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis flowers, 
• $2.75 per dry-weight ounce of cannabis leaves, and
• $1.29 per ounce of fresh cannabis plant. 
All fresh cannabis plants must be weighed within two hours of harvesting. Rates are also posted on our website at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm . 
Excise tax applies to all retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products starting January 1, 2018The cannabis excise tax applies to all retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products starting January 1, 2018, including sales of cannabis and cannabis products retailers may have purchased prior to January 1, 2018. If you are a cannabis retailer, you are required to collect the cannabis excise tax from your customers on each retail sale of cannabis or cannabis products starting January 1, 2018, and pay the excise tax to a distributor. More information on how to remit the cannabis excise tax on your inventory purchased prior to January 1, 2018, is coming soon. 
Invoice Requirements
Every sale or transport of cannabis or cannabis products must be recorded on an invoice or receipt. Cannabis licensees are required to keep invoices for a minimum of seven years. Distributors (or in some cases manufacturers) are responsible for collecting the cannabis cultivation and excise taxes, and the invoices they provide must include, among other specified requirements, the amount of tax collected. Retailers, cultivators, and manufacturers must keep these invoices as verification that the appropriate tax was paid. Distributors are liable for paying the cannabis taxes to the CDTFA.
Retailers are required to provide purchasers with a receipt or other similar document that includes the following statement, 
“The cannabis excise taxes are included in the total amount of this invoice.” See our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm  for more information on invoicing and recordkeeping requirements.  
For more informationThere are very specific requirements for the cannabis industry. Read our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm  for helpful information. If you have additional questions, you may call our 
Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711) Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.

A new law adjusts the 2022 hazardous waste environmental fee rates and changes the

New fee rates effective January 1, 2022

New employee threshold change
Currently, organizations operating in California with 50 or more employees who are each employed more than 500 hours in California during the prior calendar year, must file and pay the environmental fee. Starting January 1, 2022, the employee threshold for the environmental fee will change from 50 or more employees to 100 or more employees. Organizations in certain industry groups, as identified by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), with 100 or more qualifying employees must file and pay the fee, unless otherwise exempted. This affects your upcoming returns as follows:
• Your 2021 return is due February 28, 2022, if your organization had 50 or more qualifying employees during the 2021 calendar year. 
• Your 2022 return is due February 28, 2023, if your organization had 100 or more qualifying employees during the 2022 calendar year.
Online filing required
You are required to file your annual Environmental Fee Return using our Online Services  
system. If you don’t already have a username and password in our system, you will need to create one. For assistance with creating a username and password, or for information about filing online, please view our T utorials .
Your environmental fee supports California
We collect the hazardous waste environmental fee on behalf of DTSC. This fee supports the protection of California’s communities and the environment from toxic contamination and also helps DTSC promote the use of safer consumer products.

New Reporting Requirements for Tobacco Products 
Distributors Effective January 1, 2020
Beginning January 1, 2020, tobacco products distributors will be required to report the 
wholesale cost of electronic cigarettes and vaping products that contain nicotine separately from the wholesale cost of all other tobacco products they distribute. Distributors will also be required to report their total sales of electronic cigarettes and vaping products that contain nicotine by customer (buyer). These new reporting requirements are based on Governor Newsom’s September 16, 2019, Executive Order N-18-19, and the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration’s authority under Revenue and Taxation Code section 30454. The CDTFA-501-CT, Tobacco Products Distributor Tax Return,  will be revised 
and a new schedule, CDTFA-810-CTN, Electronic Cigarettes and Vaping Products That Contain Nicotine - Tax Disbursement Schedule,  added to meet these new requirements.
Revisions to: CDTFA-501-CT, Tobacco Products Distributor Tax Return
Line 1 will be separated into three lines:
• Line (1a) will be used to report the wholesale cost of all electronic cigarettes and vaping 
products that contain nicotine distributed. If you report an amount on this line, you must also complete the new schedule, CDTFA-810-CTN, Electronic Cigarettes and Vaping Products That Contain Nicotine - Tax Disbursement Schedule. (See below.)
• Line (1b) will be used to report the wholesale cost of all other tobacco products (excluding amounts reported on line 1a) distributed.
• Line (1c) will be used to report the total wholesale cost of all tobacco products distributed. Line 1c will be the total of lines 1a and 1b.
New Schedule: CDTFA-810-CTN, Electronic Cigarettes and Vaping Products That 
Contain Nicotine - Tax Disbursement Schedule
You must file this schedule with the Tobacco Products Distributor Tax Return  and report the 
information below for each buyer:
• Buyer Name
• Address (street address, city, and ZIP code where the product was delivered)
• California Tobacco Products License Number
Provide the California license number using only the 9-digit numeric portion 
without dashes. For example, “123-456789” would be reported as “123456789.”
If you are an in-state distributor and a licensed retailer selling to your retail location, provide your own retailer license number. 
If you are an out-of-state distributor and selling directly to a consumer, write “N/A” (for not applicable).
• Total Sales of Electronic Cigarettes and Vaping Products
Provide the total sales amount (excluding sales tax) of all electronic cigarettes and vaping products that contain nicotine. Round to the nearest whole dollar.

L-859Sales and Use Tax Rates for Diesel Fuel Changes 
October 1, 2022
Starting October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, Assembly Bill 194  (Stats. 2022, 
ch. 55) added a temporary partial sales and use tax exemption (3.9375%) on the sale, 
storage, use, or other consumption of diesel fuel. The prepayment rate for diesel fuel for the period October 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023, is also being revised to reflect the new sales and use tax rate. The new rates are as follows:
Sales and Use Tax Rates
Type of FuelPrepayment per Gallon Sales and Use Tax Rate *
July 1, 2022, through  
September 30, 2022October 1, 2022,

Diesel fuel47 cents ($0.470) 33 cents ($0.330) 13.00% 9.0625%
* You must add district taxes where applicable. District taxes continue to apply to sales and purchases of diesel fuel and are not included in the AB 194 partial sales and use tax exemption. District tax rates for your area are available on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/cdtfa105.pdf .
 
The following rates, effective July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023, remain unchanged:
Sales and Use Tax Rates
Type of Fuel Prepayment per Gallon Sales and Use Tax Rates *
Gasoline (motor vehicle fuel) 9 cents ($0.090) 2.25%
Aircraft jet fuel 18 cents ($0.180) 7.25%
Aviation gasoline Not applicable Not applicable
* You must add district taxes where applicable. District tax rates for your area are available on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/cdtfa105.pd f.
Excise Tax Rates per Gallon
Type of Fuel Effective July 1, 2022
Gasoline (motor vehicle fuel) 53.9 cents ($0.539)
Aircraft jet fuel12 cents ($0.02)
Diesel fuel 41.0 cents ($0.410)
Aviation gasoline118 cents ($0.18)
1Excise taxes on aircraft jet fuel and aviation gasoline are not subject to an annual adjustment.
How are the sales tax prepayment rates determined?
The prepayment rate for each gallon of gasoline, aircraft jet fuel, and diesel fuel is calculated at 80 percent of the combined state and local sales tax on the average selling price of the fuel, excluding sales tax, as reported by industry publications. We are required to establish the sales tax prepayment rates by March 1
 of each year. The sales tax prepayment rate for 
diesel fuel is being updated effective October 1, 2022, to reflect the new partial exemption. We may continue to adjust these rates during the year if changes in fuel prices cause fuel retailers to prepay too much or too little tax. How are the excise tax rates determined?
We are required to adjust the motor vehicle fuel and diesel fuel excise tax rates annually on 
July 1 of each year, by the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index, as calculated by the Department of Finance.
Are any other fuel rates changing? 
No. Although there is a sales and use tax partial exemption on diesel fuel for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, the previous sales and use tax rates for gasoline, aircraft jet fuel, and aviation gasoline remain in effect. The excise tax rates for all motor vehicle and diesel fuels also continue to be in effect.

711Help for Mobile Food Vendors 
with Local and District Taxes  
As a mobile food vendor that sells food or drinks from a truck, stand, or wheeled 
cart with no fixed, physical location, we understand that correctly reporting local and district taxes and determining the proper tax rate to collect on your retail sales can be complicated, especially if you own a business that travels to multiple cities and counties to make sales. This notice provides general information about local and district taxes which may help you avoid making common errors when filing your return. 
What is local tax?
When you make retail sales in this state or for delivery into this state, the sale is generally 
subject to either sales or use tax. The current statewide sales and use tax rate is 7.25 percent, which includes the 1.25 percent local tax. When you file your sales and use tax return, you must properly allocate your sales to the local jurisdiction where the sale or use occurs. This ensures that the local jurisdiction will receive the correct funding of local tax.
How do I allocate the local tax?
You may be at multiple locations throughout the day, making it difficult to keep track of 
every city in which you make sales. Therefore, as a mobile food vendor with no fixed, physical location, you are allowed to allocate sales through the countywide pools of the counties in which the sales occur by using Schedule B, Detailed Allocation by County of Sales and Use Tax Transactions,  when you file your sales and use tax return. 
What is district tax? 
District taxes are voter-approved transactions (sales) and use taxes imposed by cities, 
counties, and other local jurisdictions. The base sales and use tax rate is 7.25 percent; however, total sales and use tax rates are higher in areas (taxing districts) where district taxes are imposed. 
What is the correct district tax rate to charge my customer?
Your sales will generally be subject to the district tax of the taxing districts in which 
you travel to make taxable sales. You will be responsible to collect, report, and pay the statewide rate of 7.25 percent plus any district taxes that are in effect at each location where you make sales. You will use Schedule A, District Tax Allocation, to allocate district taxes you collected when you file your sales and use tax returns.
Where can I find the district tax rates? 
You may find the tax rates for each district on our California City and County Sales and 
Use Tax Rates webpage. Go to our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov , select Tax and Fee 
Rates,  then choose Sales and Use Tax Rates . This webpage includes a look-up tool; 
Find a Sales and Use Tax Rate by Address , which allows you to find a tax rate based on 
an address. MARCH 2020

JANUARY 2022  
L-838New Tax and Reporting Requirements for  
Retailers of Electronic Cigarettes  
Containing or Sold with Nicotine
Beginning July 1, 2022, electronic cigarette retailers are required to collect from purchasers 
at the time of sale a 12.5 percent California electronic cigarette excise tax (CECET) on the retail selling price of the electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine. Retailers are required to collect the tax, electronically file a return, and pay the tax to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
What are electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine?
Electronic cigarettes mean any of the following:
• Any device or delivery system used to deliver aerosolized or vaporized nicotine to a person when sold in combination with any liquid or substance containing nicotine, examples include: eCigarettes, eCigars, ePipes, vape pens, or eHookahs.
• Any component, part, or accessory that is used during the operation of the device or delivery system when sold in combination with any liquid or substance containing nicotine.
• A liquid or substance containing nicotine, such as eJuice or eLiquid, whether sold separately or sold in combination with any device.
How do I register for a CECET permit (account)?
If you already have a Cigarette and Tobacco Products Retailer’s License (CRL) with us and you indicated that you sell electronic cigarettes and nicotine products at the time of registration or renewal, we will register you with a CECET account by July 1, 2022. Starting June 2022, we will begin notifying those retailers by mail that we have registered them with a CECET account. 
However, if you currently have a CRL license and indicated that you do not sell electronic 
cigarettes and nicotine products when you registered for or renewed your license, we will not  automatically register you with a CECET account. If you decide to sell electronic 
cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine in the future, you must register with us at that time. Beginning June 1, 2022, you may register for a CECET account using our Online Services Port al:
1. Visit https://onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov/_/ .
2. Log in to your account with your username and password. 
3. Select More  under the I Want To section.
4. Select Register a  New Business Activity . 
5. Follow the prompts to complete the account registration process. 
What must I do once I have a CECET account?
Beginning July 1, 2022, you are required to:
• Collect the tax from purchasers at the time you sell electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine. 
• Provide the purchaser with a receipt or other document that separately identifies the California electronic cigarette excise tax and the amount the purchaser paid on each retail sale of electronic cigarettes containing or sold with nicotine.JANUARY 2022

The 911 Surcharge rate amount will not exceed $0.80 per access line or retail transaction. If you have questions regarding the 911 Surcharge rate, please visit the Cal OES website at www.caloes.ca.go v.
All Returns Will Be Filed Monthly
Service suppliers that are currently filing 911 Surcharge returns on a quarterly or annual 
basis will be changed to a monthly basis beginning with the January 2020 reporting period. Additional filing information will be provided in a separate notice.
Helpful Terms
Below are some helpful terms related to the changes to the surcharge.

Cannabis Mark-up Rate Remains at 80 Percent
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) is responsible for determining the cannabis 
mark-up rate every six months. We have determined the cannabis mark-up rate will remain unchanged at 80 percent  for the remainder of the 2020 calendar year. To make this determination, we used an analysis of 
statewide market data to calculate the mark-up rate between the wholesale cost and the retail selling price of cannabis and cannabis products. 
The 15 percent cannabis excise tax is based on the average market price of the cannabis or cannabis products 
sold in a retail sale. The mark-up rate must be used by distributors to compute the average market price of cannabis or cannabis products sold or transferred to a retailer in an arm’s length transaction. In an arm’s length transaction, the average market price is the retailer’s wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products plus the mark-up rate determined by us. 
For current and prior cannabis mark-up rates, see our Special Taxes and Fees rate page at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm , under Cannabis Taxes . 
For more information
We encourage you to read our online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm .

L-872 (2-23) FRONTImportant Information for Used Motor Vehicle Dealers
 Paying Tax to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
You are receiving this letter because you have been identified as a used motor vehicle dealer (dealer) who is currently required to pay sales tax directly to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) when you submit a vehicle registration application. Some dealers may encounter situations where payments made to DMV do not match payments included on their sales and use tax returns filed with us. If you receive notification from us about additional amounts due, such as a Notice of Demand, then you may request a report of the payments you have made to DMV that were received by CDTFA. To request your report of payments, please contact our Customer Service Center. Contact information is available at the bottom of this letter.
Please be aware that CDTFA receives payment information from DMV monthly. Depending on when a sale occurs and 
when you make your corresponding tax payment, there may be a delay in your DMV tax payments being applied to your sales and use tax account. A balance will be displayed on your sales and use tax account until we receive your payment from DMV. In addition, it is critical that the information you put on the Report of Sale (ROS) is accurate and complete so that there are no delays in the posting of your payments that could result in CDTFA issuing you a bill.
To further help you during this transitional process of changing who you make your payments to, we have included some 
additional information, reminders, and resources below: 
Sales and use tax reporting  
•  You must continue to timely file your sales and use tax returns with us and report all your retail sales of used motor 
vehicles, including sales where you paid tax to DMV, in addition to sales of other items. The return also includes a line 
for tax paid to DMV and a schedule you are required to fill out – CDTFA-531-MV, Used Vehicle Dealers – Sales Report .
1
•  You must report your sales in the period the sale occurred, based on the ROS date, and not when you receive payment 
for the vehicle. For example, if you make a sale in February, receive payment from your customer in March, and register or pay the tax to DMV in March, you must report the February sale on your February sales and use tax return that would be due on March 31
st and not on your March return that would be due on April 30th. 
•  Your payments should be submitted to DMV at the time of registration and will be applied to your sales and use tax 
account based on the ROS date. If you do not report your sales in the correct reporting periods, you may receive billings from us. 
•  You are required to provide the vehicle selling price reported to DMV for each vehicle sold on form CDTFA-531-MV. 
DMV only collects the tax on the vehicle sales price. Other taxable charges, such as document fees, smog certification fees, mandatory warranties, among others must still be reported on line 1 (Total Sales) of your sales and use tax return. 
  Example : You paid tax to DMV based on the selling price of the vehicle. You also charged your customer a fee for 
the preparation of documents (doc fee), which is a taxable charge made in connection with the sale of the vehicle. You must report both the sales price of the vehicle and the doc fee on line 1 of your sales and use tax return; however, on CDTFA 531-MV you would only list the sales price of the vehicle and the amount of tax paid to DMV.
1 www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/cdtfa531mv.pdfL-872 (2-23) BACKDMV payments  
• You must complete and submit an ROS timely, as required by DMV.
•  You must provide DMV your seller’s permit number along with your tax payment to ensure we are able to apply your 
payment to your sales and use tax account.   
Please note : If you use a service provider to electronically report vehicle sales, contact your provider to ensure your 
seller’s permit number is accurately recorded on each ROS.
• You may contact DMV by email at DMVTAXINQ@dmv.ca.gov  for confirmation of your payments.
Online webinars  
We frequently host sales and use tax return preparation webinars for used motor vehicle dealers. If you are interested in 
attending a seminar, please visit our Tax Education Events webpage at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/seminar/ . Then, click Used Car 
Dealers Tax Return Preparation Webinar , then select Register Online  to sign up.

Partial Sales and Use Tax Exemption for  
Zero Emission Vehicles Effective January 1, 2023,  
through December 31, 2027
Beginning January 1, 2023, through December 31, 2027, a new law provides for a partial 
sales and use tax exemption on qualifying zero or near-zero (zero) emission motor vehicles (vehicles) purchased or leased by qualified buyers. Eligibility for the exemption is based on the buyer’s household income, where they reside, and the vehicle leased or purchased. 
Clean Cars 4 All 
The California Air Resources Board (CARB), in association with local air districts, 
administers the Clean Cars 4 All (CC4A). The program is designed to provide incentives to lower-income California drivers to replace their older, high-polluting motor vehicles with zero emission vehicles. The current CC4A program provides qualified buyers with grants they can use towards the purchase or lease of an eligible vehicle. For more information about the program, please visit the Vehicles  tab of our Tax Guide for Green Technology at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/green-technology.htm#Vehicles . 
Qualified buyers
Qualified buyers are those who receive an award letter, or other approval documentation, 
issued by the local air district in which they live that has implemented the CC4A program. For information about buyer eligibility, please visit participating air district official CC4A webpages. A listing of air districts currently implementing this program is available on the CC4A Implementing Air Districts  webpage at ww2.arb.ca.gov/cc4a-implementing-air-districts .
Dealers
Your sales or leases of eligible vehicles to qualifying buyers are subject to tax at a reduced 
rate. The applicable tax rate for eligible transactions is the current tax rate minus the 3.9375 percent partial exemption. The reduced sales or use tax rate is generally applied to the total selling price of the vehicle before incentives are applied, such as the grant from CC4A.
To report your sales of eligible zero emission vehicles on your sales and use tax return, 
report the total selling price in your total sales. Then, claim a partial exemption for your qualifying sales of motor vehicles to qualified persons as a Zero Emissions Vehicle Exemption  deduction on your return. 
To document the partially exempt sale, you must obtain a timely partial exemption certificate from your customer. See the Exemption certificate  section below.
Exemption certificate
A partial exemption certificate must be issued by the qualified buyer to the dealer to 
document the partially exempt sale. We have a partial exemption form, CDTFA-230-ZEV, Partial Exemption – Zero Emission Vehicle , which will be available on our website at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/forms.htm  by January 1, 2023.

711 Help for Caterers with Local and District Taxes 
As a caterer that serves meals, food, or drinks at your customers’ premises, we 
understand that allocating local tax correctly and knowing the proper district tax rate to collect on your retail sales can be complicated, especially if you own a business that travels to various cities and counties. This notice provides general information about local and district taxes and may help you avoid making common errors when fling your return. 
W
hat is local tax? 
W
hen you make retail sales in this state or for delivery into this state, the sale is 
generally subject to either sales or use tax. The current statewide sales and use tax rate is 7.25 percent, which includes the 1.25 percent local tax. When you fle your sales and use tax return, you must properly allocate your sales to the local jurisdiction where the sale or use occurs. This ensures that the local jurisdictions will receive the correct funding of local tax. 
H
ow do I allocate the local tax? 
A
s a caterer, your sales are generally subject to sales tax. Even though you might travel 
throughout various local jurisdictions, you should allocate sales directly to your in-state business location where sales are negotiated, and catering orders are taken. You will use Schedule C, Detailed Allocation by Location of Sales and Use Tax Transactions , to 
allocate local tax to your business location when you fle your sales and use tax returns. 
W
hat is district tax? 
D
istrict taxes are voter-approved transactions (sales) and use taxes imposed by cities, 
counties, and other local jurisdictions. The base statewide sales and use tax rate is 7.25 percent; however, total sales and use tax rates are higher in areas (taxing districts) where district taxes are imposed. 
W
hat is the correct district tax rate to charge my customers? 
U
nlike with the local tax, your catering sales will generally be subject to the district tax 
of the taxing district where the catering event takes place. You will be responsible to collect, report, and pay the statewide rate of 7.25 percent plus  any district taxes that 
are in effect where each catering event occurs. You will use Schedule A, District Tax Allocation , to allocate the district taxes you collected when you fle your sales and use 
tax returns. 
W
here can I fnd the district tax rates? 
Y
ou may fnd the tax rates for each district on our California City and County Sales 
and Use Tax Rates webpage. Go to our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov , select Tax and 
Fee Rates , then choose Sales and Use Tax Rates . This webpage includes a look-up

Exemption for Items and Materials Used to Modify Vehicles 
for Physically Handicapped Persons Expanded to Include 
Veterans with Severe Burn Injuries
Beginning July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2030, the definition of “physically handicapped 
persons” is expanded to include veterans with a severe burn injury. Current law provides for 
an exemption from sales and use tax for the sale or purchase of items and materials when 
used to modify a vehicle for physically handicapped persons.
If you are a retailer who sells property used to modify a vehicle for a physically handicapped 
person, including veterans with a severe burn injury, your sales are not subject to tax 
provided you retain proper documentation. Specifically, tax does not apply to the sale of 
items and materials that:
•Are used to modify a vehicle when such items and materials are necessary to enable
the vehicle to be used to transport the qualifying person(s), and
•Are incorporated into, attached to, or installed on the vehicle.
Please continue to include your sales of these items and materials in your reported total 
gross sales on your sales and use tax return. You will claim the deduction for these sales on 
your return under the “Other” category.

t-of-State Retailers 
As a registered out-of-state retailer, we understand that allocating local tax correctly, and 
knowing the proper district tax rate to collect on your retail sales delivered into California 
can be complicated. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) 
is here to help with your local and district tax questions. This notice provides general 
information and examples that may help you better understand local and district taxes. 
Local t ax 
Lo
cal taxes a re sales and use taxes imposed by local jurisdictions, usually cities or counties, 
u
nder the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law. When you make retail sales in 
C
alifornia or for delivery into California, that are not otherwise tax exempt, the sale is subject 
to the current statewide sales and use tax rate of 7.25 percent, which includes local tax. 
When fling your sales and use tax return, you must properly allocate the local tax. This 
ensures the local jurisdictions will receive the correct funding of local tax. When sales tax 
does not apply, for example when the sale is made outside the state, use tax generally 
applies to the use, storage, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased 
from a retailer for use in California. 
Generally, sales tax transactions should be allocated directly to the local jurisdiction where 
the sale occurred, using Schedule C; while use tax transactions are usually allocated 
indirectly to the county of the jurisdiction where the property is used, using Schedule B. 
District tax 
District t axes a re voter-approved transactions (sales) and use taxes imposed by cities, 
counties, and other local jurisdictions. Total sales and use tax rates are higher than the 
current statewide sales and use tax rate of 7.25 percent in areas where district taxes are 
im
posed. When fling your sales and use tax return, you must properly report district taxes 
on Schedule A. 
You may be required to collect, report, and pay district tax for property you ship to your 
Ca
lifornia customers in taxing districts where you are “engaged in business.” A retailer is 
“engaged in business” in a district if the retailer: 
•Owns or leases any real or tangible personal property including, but not limited to, a
computer server, in the district.
•Maintains, occupies, or uses, directly or indirectly, or through a subsidiary or agent,a permanent or temporary of ce, place of distribution, sales or sample room,
warehouse or storage place, or other physical place of business in the district.
•Has a representative, agent, or independent contractor operating in the district onyour behalf or under your authority, or under the authority of a subsidiary, for purposeof making sales, taking orders, assembling or installing merchandise, trainingcustomers, making deliveries, or otherwise establishing or maintaining a market foryour products.
•Receives rental payments from the leases of tangible personal property located inthe district, such as leases of machinery, equipment, and furniture.
•Sells or leases vehicles or undocumented vessels which will be registered in the district.
•Has total combined sales of tangible personal property in California or for delivery inCalifornia, by the retailer and all persons related* to the retailer, exceeding $500,000in the preceding or current calendar year.

Before EDD launched the Box.com application, customers were limited to faxing, emailing, and mailing documents during a tax audit or while working with a compliance representative. While these options are still available to customers, Box.com application provides a simple and streamlined process for submitting employer records. EDD’s Tax Branch is looking to expand the use of this tool to include the outbound functionality, which will allow them to share data externally with their customers.

Changes in Capital Account Reporting
Beginning with tax year 2020, partnerships are required to use the tax basis method for reporting their partners’ capital accounts on federal Schedule K-1 for federal income tax purposes. A tax basis capital account is an important tool for determining to what extent annual losses can be claimed, and for calculating gain or loss from the disposition of a partnership interest. 
Although California generally conforms to the Internal Revenue Code, there are differences between federal and California tax law. To account for these differences, the 
California Franchise 
Tax Board (FTB)  has followed the federal changes in Schedule 
K-1 reporting requirements. FTB requires an entity taxed as a partnership to report its partners’ or members’ capital accounts on Schedule K-1 (565) and Schedule K-1 (568) using the tax basis method calculated under California law. 
This change is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. However, FTB has issued FTB Notice 2022-01, giving entities taxed as partnerships the option to report partners’ and members’ capital account information using the “tax basis method” as determined under either the federal or California law for tax year 2021. 
Entities taxed as partnerships will be allowed to use the federal tax basis capital account for the tax year 2021 only and are not allowed to use the federal tax basis in lieu of their California tax basis for any other purposes, including reporting or determining their California tax liability. For tax year 2022 and thereafter, FTB will require taxpayers who file Form 565 or 568 to report their partners’ or members’ capital accounts on Schedule K-1 using the tax basis method as determined under California law.
For more information on capital account reporting, please visit FTB’s Capital Account Reporting  webpage at

Cultivation Tax No Longer Applies
Beginning July 1, 2022, the cultivation tax no longer applies to cannabis or cannabis products that enter the 
commercial market. Additionally, distributors and manufacturers are no longer required to collect the cultivation tax from cultivators when a cultivator sells or transfers cannabis to a manufacturer or distributor on or after July 1, 2022.
What happens when a cultivator sells cannabis to a distributor or manufacturer on or after July 1, 2022?
The distributor or manufacturer must not collect the cultivation tax from the cultivator. The invoice between the cultivator and distributor or manufacturer should indicate no cultivation tax was due.
What happens when a cultivator sells cannabis to a distributor or manufacturer before  
July 1, 2022, and the cannabis or cannabis products enter the commercial market on or after July 1, 2022?
The cultivation tax is not due on cannabis or cannabis products that enter the commercial market on or after July 1, 2022, even if a cultivator sold or transferred cannabis prior to July 1, 2022. Any cultivation tax collected on cannabis that entered the commercial market on or after July 1, 2022, must be returned to the cultivator that originally paid the cultivation tax. Cannabis enters the commercial market when the cannabis or cannabis products pass the required testing and quality assurance review.
What happens if cultivation tax cannot be returned to the cultivator?
Cultivation tax that cannot be returned to the cultivator who paid it is considered excess cultivation tax collected and a distributor must pay the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) the excess cultivation tax collected.
How does a manufacturer pay excess cultivation tax collected?
A manufacturer who collected cultivation tax and cannot return it to the cultivator who paid it must transfer the excess cultivation tax collected to a distributor for the distributor to pay the excess cultivation tax collected to CDTFA.
How does a distributor pay excess cultivation tax?
A distributor must pay excess cultivation tax collected to CDTFA by reporting and paying the excess cultivation tax collected on their next cannabis tax return.
We encourage you to read our online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm , 
for more information about the upcoming changes.

Effective July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) recently approved 
the new tax rate of 56.32 percent effective July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024. We are required to annually determine the tax rate on other tobacco products (products other than cigarettes), which is equivalent to the combined rate of tax imposed on cigarettes.
How does the tax apply?
Tobacco products distributors are required to apply this rate to all distributions of other tobacco products in California during the effective period. 
The tax is based on the distributor’s wholesale cost, which is the cost of the tobacco products charged to the distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances (see Revenue and Taxation Code 
section 30017  and Regulation 4076 ). This cost is typically 
the invoiced price of the tobacco products charged by a manufacturer or importer to the licensed distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances.
When is the tax due?
The tax is due at the time the tobacco products are distributed in California. The tax rate 
that applies is the rate in effect at the time the tobacco product is sold by the distributor . 
You may find current and historical tobacco products tax rates on our website at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm .

Efective June 27, 2017, certain transfers by pawnbrokers may no longer be subject to 
tax. Revenue and Taxation Code (R&TC) section 6010.15 now provides that when a pawnbroker transfers property back to the person that had pledged the property to the pawnbroker as security for a loan, it is no longer taxable under certain conditions. 
New Law 
Starting June 27, 2017, through December 31, 2021, tax does not apply to transactions in which a borrower buys back their pledged property from a pawnbroker if all  of the 
following conditions are met: 
• Te buyback occurs within six (6) months of the borrower defaulting on the loan 
(the date title to the property vests with the pawnbroker). 
• Te borrower pays the remaining unpaid loan balance, including any charges and 
interest, as of the date the borrower defaults, together with one of the following: 
º For loans of less than $2,500: the borrower must pay the allowable charges and 
interest from the date of default to the date the borrower buys back the pledged property. 
º For loans of $2,500 or more: the borrower must pay charges and interest due based on the last monthly contractual interest rate from the date of default to the date the borrower buys back the pledged property. 
• Te borrower has proof, such as a receipt or similar document, that they originally 
paid sales tax on the item. 
For more information on charges and interest allowed by pawnbrokers, please refer to Chapter 2 (Pawnbroker Regulations) of Division 8 of the California Financial Code .

Cannabis Rates to Remain the Same on January 1, 2021
Due to new legislation, Assembly Bill 1872 (Stats. 2020, ch. 93) , the cannabis excise tax mark-up rate and the 
cultivation tax rates will not change on January 1, 2021.
Cannabis Excise Tax Mark-up Rate
The cannabis excise tax mark-up rate used by distributors to compute the average market price of cannabis or 
cannabis products sold or transferred to a cannabis retailer in an arm’s length transaction will remain at 80 percent for the period of January 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021. 
The 15 percent cannabis excise tax is applied to the average market price of cannabis or cannabis products sold 
in a retail sale. The mark-up rate, currently set at 80 percent, is used when calculating the average market price to determine the cannabis excise tax due in an arm’s length transaction. 
• In an arm’s length transaction, the average market price is the retailer’s wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products plus the mark-up rate determined by the CDTFA. 
• In a nonarm’s length transaction, the average market price is the cannabis retailer’s gross receipts from the retail sale of the cannabis or cannabis products. 
Cultivation Tax Rates
The cultivation tax rates for the 2020 calendar year will remain unchanged for the 2021 calendar year. 
CANNABIS CATEGORYCULTIVATION TAX RATES  
January 1, 2020 – December 31, 2021
Flower per dry-weight ounce $9.65
Leaves per dry-weight ounce $2.87
Fresh cannabis plant per ounce $1.35
The CDTFA will adjust the cultivation tax rates annually for inflation beginning with the 2022 calendar year.
For current and prior cannabis mark-up and tax rates, see our Special Taxes and Fees  rate page at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm , under Cannabis Taxes .

California Department of Tax and Fee 
Administration, Formerly Part of the  
California State Board of Equalization
 
Dear Taxpayer/Feepayer: 
This is to notify you that, beginning July 1, 2017, most duties performed by the California 
State Board of Equalization (Board) will be transferred to the newly created California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) and the Office of Tax Appeals. This restructure is a result of Assembly Bill 102, The Taxpayer Transparency and Fairness Act of 2017, which was recently enacted into law. 
The Board will continue to perform the duties it was assigned by the state Constitution, 
which include administering programs related to property taxes, insurance taxes, and excise taxes on alcohol. 
Until December 31, 2017, the Board will continue to hear taxpayer appeals on all types of 
tax and fee matters. However, beginning January 1, 2018, the Board will only hear appeals related to the programs it constitutionally administers, and the Office of Tax Appeals will hear appeals on all other tax and fee matters, such as franchise and personal income tax appeals, sales and use tax, and other special taxes and fees. 
Requirements to register, file, and pay taxes and to meet other obligations will be the same 
as required prior to July 1, 2017. Schedules, forms, and payments will generally be the same during the transition. You will be notified of any future changes and are encouraged 
to visit CDTFA’s website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov for more information. 
Your patience during the transition is appreciated. Please call 1-800-400-7115 with any 
questions.

The first adjustment is based on the percentage change in the CCPI from October 2021 to October 2022. Subsequent annual adjustments will be made by DFW relative to the subsequent 12-month periods. We will notify you annually of the adjusted rate.
How the fee applies
The OSPA fee is imposed on owners of crude oil, petroleum products, and renewable fuel. Marine terminal operators, refinery operators, renewable fuel receiving facility operators, and renewable fuel production facility operators are responsible for collecting the OSPA  fee from the owner.

Special Notice
New Tax Rate on Other Tobacco Products  
Effective July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019
The new tobacco products tax rate is 62.78 percent effective July 1, 2018, through 
June 30, 2019. Tobacco products distributors are required to apply this rate to all distributions of other tobacco products during the effective period.
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) approved 
the new tax rate. The CDTFA is required to determine the tax rate annually on other tobacco products (products other than cigarettes) that is equivalent to the combined rate of tax imposed on cigarettes. The tobacco products tax is imposed on the distribution of tobacco products in California and is paid by tobacco products distributors.
The tobacco products tax is due at the time the tobacco products are distributed in 
California. The tobacco products tax is based on the distributor’s wholesale cost. Wholesale cost is the cost of the tobacco products to the distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances (see Revenue and Taxation Code section 30017 and  
Regulation 4076 ). This cost is typically the invoiced price of the tobacco products 
charged by a manufacturer or importer to the licensed distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances. Accordingly, the tax rate that applies is the rate in effect at the time the tobacco product is sold by the distributor.
You may find current and historical tobacco products tax rates on the CDTFA website 
at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm .
For more information regarding cigarette and tobacco products taxes, see the online Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax and Fee guide at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cigarette-and-tobacco-products.htm , or call the Customer Service Center at  
1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711) Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays; from the main menu, select the option,  “Special Taxes and Fees .”

Cultivation Tax Ends on July 1, 2022
Beginning July 1, 2022, the cultivation tax no longer applies to cannabis or cannabis products entering the 
commercial market. Cannabis enters the commercial market when the cannabis or cannabis products pass the 
required testing and quality assurance review. 
Changes to Your Cultivation Tax Requirements – Starting July 1, 2022
• Distributors and manufacturers (including microbusinesses authorized to distribute or manufacture) are no 
longer required to collect the cultivation tax from cultivators. 
• Cultivators (including microbusinesses authorized to cultivate) are no longer responsible for paying the 
cultivation tax to manufacturers or distributors when cultivators sell or transfer cannabis to another licensee.
• Cultivation tax is not due on cannabis or cannabis products entering the commercial market on or after  
July 1, 2022, even if you received cannabis from a cultivator prior to July 1, 2022.
• Any cultivation tax collected on cannabis that enters the commercial market on or after  July 1, 2022, must be 
returned to the cultivator that originally paid the cultivation tax.
What to Do If Excess Cultivation Tax is Collected
Cultivation tax that cannot be returned to the cultivator who paid it is considered excess cultivation tax collected. 
• A manufacturer that has collected the cultivation tax and is not able to return it to the cultivator who paid it, 
must transfer the excess cultivation tax collected to a distributor to remit to the California Department of Tax 
and Fee Administration (CDTFA). 
• A distributor that has collected the cultivation tax and is not able to return it to the cultivator who paid it, must 
remit the excess cultivation tax collected to CDTFA. 
• A distributor should report and pay any excess cultivation tax collected on their next cannabis tax return. 
Additional guidance on how to report excess cultivation tax on your cannabis tax return will be provided in a 
separate notice.
Keep Accurate Records
Each licensee in a transaction should keep clear records to document when the cultivation tax was collected or not 
collected, returned to a cultivator, transferred to a distributor, or when excess cultivation tax was paid to CDTFA.
Legislation Information
Assembly Bill 195 (Stats. 2022, ch. 56), which revises the Cannabis Tax Law, was approved on June 30, 2022. 
We will provide additional information once it becomes available in future special notices and on our website. We

Special Notice
Alterations to New Clothing are Taxable
Registration
If you do not already hold a seller’s permit and you perform alterations to new clothing, 
you are required to register for one with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) to report and pay tax on your alteration charges.  Please visit our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov and click the Register  button. 
If you are a tailor (that is not a clothes cleaning or dyeing establishment) who alters clothing, your charges for altering new clothing are considered to be for finalizing the creation of that new clothing and are subject to sales and use tax.  However, if you alter used clothing, those charges are not subject to tax.
Clothing is considered new if:
•The labels or tags are still attached;
•It has unfinished hems, cuffs or other parts; or
•It has not been previously worn by the customer (except to try on).
Examples of alterations to new clothing may include, but are not limited to:
•Shortening/lengthening sleeves or pants
•Modifying waist sizes
•Hemming
•Restyling the item
•Changing design
•Adding/removing material from the item
As a tailor, the charges you make for altering new clothing are taxable regardless of whether 
the charges are separately stated or included in the selling price of the clothing.
Clothing is considered used if:
•It has been previously worn by the customer; or
•It is in a state of disrepair (i.e., worn out, or torn).
As a tailor, the charges you make to alter used clothing are generally not subject to tax.  The 
charges for altering used clothing are generally not subject to tax when such alterations are performed to refit or repair the item to its intended use for which it was created or produced.  Examples of alterations to used clothing may include, but are not limited to:
•Replacing a zipper or button(s);
•Mending or patching a hole; or
•Taking in (or letting out) seams for a better fit.
Charges for alterations such as lengthening a pair of pants or taking in a skirt’s waist are also not subject to tax as long as the clothing is considered used.  
For more information
If you have additional questions regarding this notice, you may call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711).  Customer service representatives are available weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.

CDTFA-490-C REV. 5 (4-24)
Offer In Compromise 
Application
for Corporations, LLCs, Partnerships, Trusts, and Other Business OrganizationsAre you an OIC candidate?
The Offer in Compromise (OIC) program is for taxpayers that 
do not have the income, assets, or means to pay their tax liabilities in full, and who will not have the resources to pay their liabilities in the foreseeable future. It allows a taxpayer to offer a lesser amount for payment of an undisputed final tax liability on a closed-out account.
Effective January 1, 2009, through January 1, 2028, the OIC program will extend to qualified active businesses where the taxpayer has not received tax or fee reimbursement for taxs and fees owed to the state, to successors of businesses that may have inherited tax liabilities of the predecessors, and to consumers who incurred a use tax liability.
Generally, we approve an OIC when the amount offered represents the most we can expect to receive from the taxpayer’s current income or assets and future income for a reasonable period of time, and the OIC is in the best interest of the state . Although each case is evaluated 
based on its own merit, we give the following factors strong consideration:
• The entity’s ability to pay
• The amount of equity in the entity’s assets
• The entity’s present and future income
• The entity’s present and future expenses
• The potential for changed circumstances
Who should use this application?
If you are making an offer as a corporation, LLC, trust, organization, or a limited or general partnership, please use this application. To make an offer as an individual or an individual of a partnership, please download 
CDTFA-490 , Offer 
in Compromise Application , from our website or contact your 
local CDTFA office.
Can we process your offer?
We will only process your OIC application if you meet one of the following conditions:
•  You no longer have a controlling interest or association with the business that incurred the liability or a related business.
•  You represent an active business with a final liability that arose from transactions in which you did not receive tax or fee reimbursement.
• You are a consumer who accrued use tax.
•  You are a successor that inherited the liability of your predecessor.
You must also fully complete the OIC application and provide all supporting documentation.Should you continue to make installment payments while your offer is being evaluated?
 
Yes. You should continue making timely payments as established in your installment payment agreement while we consider your offer. We will strive to process your offer and respond within 30 days of receiving your completed application and documentation.
Will collection action be suspended while your offer is being evaluated?
We will usually suspend collection action while we evaluate your offer. However, submitting an offer does not automatically suspend collection activity. If delaying collection activity jeopardizes our ability to collect the amount you owe, we may continue with collection efforts.
When should you submit offered funds?  
We will notify you when it’s time to submit your offered amount. We will hold your funds in the form of a noninterest bearing deposit. If we deny your OIC, we will refund the full amount of your deposit to you, or you may choose to apply the deposit to your liability. We will not pay credit interest to you on the deposited amount if your offer is denied.

Q  What does the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) consider a fair Offer in Compromise (OIC) 
in relation to the amount due?
A  Generally, we will accept an offer when the amount offered is more than we can expect to collect within a reasonable period 
of time (typically four years), and the offered amount is in the best interest of the state. We generally give more favorable 
consideration to offers that include repayment of at least the tax or fee portion of the liability.
Q How long will it take to get a response on my OIC?
A  We are able to respond to most offers within 30 days of receipt. However, more complex accounts may take longer than 30 days 
to review.
Q Can I make payments on the offered amount?
A  The department may, in its discretion, enter into a written agreement that permits the taxpayer to pay the compromise in 
installments for a period not exceeding one year.
Q Can prior payments be applied to the offered amount?
A  No. We do not accept prior payments towards the offered amount. However, we do consider prior payments and the offered 
amount compared to the total liability when we evaluate your offer.
Q My IRS, FTB, or EDD OIC has been accepted. Will CDTFA automatically approve my offer?
A No. We evaluate your offer separately from your IRS, FTB, or EDD offer(s).
Q Will CDTFA contact me if my offer is declined?
A  Yes. We will send you a letter informing you of our decision, and in most cases, we will contact you to discuss your account and 
to determine the most appropriate resolution of your account. For example, if we determine that you have the ability to make monthly payments that exceed the amount offered, we will work with you to set up an installment payment agreement that will allow you to pay the liability in full over time.
Q Will state tax liens be released if my offer is accepted?
A  Yes. We release state tax liens upon final approval and funding of your offer. If another partner existed on the permit, we will not 
cancel the other partner’s liability nor will we release the other partner’s lien.
Q Do I need to have someone represent me?
A  We do not require you to have representation. The OIC application and process are available to all taxpayers, with or without 
representation. If you think you need representation, there are many tax professionals who have experience with the OIC process.
Q If my OIC is declined, can I apply the deposit to my liability?
A Yes. In this case, the effective date of the payment will be the date the deposit was made.
Q Where can I find forms such as CDTFA-392, Power of Attorney ?
A  Many CDTFA forms and publications, including CDTFA-392 , Power of Attorney , can be downloaded from our website at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov . If you do not have access to the Internet or you prefer to speak to someone, you can contact your local office

WRITTEN TAX ADVICE
For your protection, it is best to get tax advice in writing. You may be relieved of tax, penalty, or interest charges that are due on a transaction if we determine that we gave you incorrect written advice regarding the transaction and that you reasonably relied on that advice in failing to pay the proper amount of tax. For this relief to apply, a request for advice must be in writing, identify the taxpayer to whom the advice applies, and fully describe the facts and circumstances of the transaction.
For written advice on general tax and fee information, please visit our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/email  to email your request.

Important Reminders for Used Vehicle Dealers
Starting January 1, 2021, important changes impacting used vehicle dealers went into effect. You were previously notified of these changes in the special notice, Changes Affecting Used Vehicle Dealers and Vehicle Auction Houses Beginning January 1, 2021
1. To help with the transition, we want to provide you with some important reminders:
Sales and Use Tax Return Reminders
•	Your filing frequency with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) has been changed to a monthly reporting basis.
•	You are required to submit a new schedule, CDTFA-531-MV, Used Vehicle Dealers – Sales Report
2, with 
your return. For help completing this schedule, a video tutorial is available on our Online Services webpage at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/services/#Tutorials . From the webpage, select the Returns  heading, Sales and Use Tax subheading, 
and select How to File Schedule MV .
•	You are required to report local sales tax to the retail location where the sale takes place on Schedule C – Detailed Allocation by Location of Sales and Use Tax Transactions
3. For more information, please see our Local and District Tax 
Guide for Retailers at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/localanddistricttaxes.htm . 
•	You must enter amounts in the new line items added to your sales and use tax return to reflect the amount of sales tax and penalty you paid (if any) to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). 
•	On your return, you must continue to report your vehicle sales and other charges related to the vehicle sales on line 1, Total Sales , including, but not limited to, document fees, smog certification fees, and mandatory warranties. 
Please note: The DMV only collects the sales tax on the charge for the vehicle. Therefore, you must pay sales tax for 
other related taxable charges directly to the CDTFA.
DMV Payment Reminders
•	Certain used motor vehicle dealers are required to pay sales tax to the DMV at the same time they submit a vehicle registration application. The DMV will notify you when you are required to start paying sales tax to the DMV. If you have not been notified by the DMV, please continue making sales tax payments to the CDTFA.  
Please note: If you are unsure if you have been notified by the DMV, please contact the DMV directly.
•	You must complete and submit a Report of Sale (ROS) timely, as required by the DMV.
•	You should ensure that your seller’s permit number and ROS sales date are correct. Payments made to the DMV will 
automatically be applied to your sales and use tax account using your seller’s permit number and the ROS sales date.
Registration Update
Our records indicate you are a used vehicle dealer. If you are not a used vehicle dealer and believe you received this 
letter in error, please contact us at the number below to update your account information.

711An importer who receives a timely statement from a manufacturer is relieved from any 
obligation imposed on the sale of that lead-acid battery if the manufacturer pays the manufacturer battery fee to the CDTFA. The importer remains liable for the fee if the manufacturer does not pay.
An importer who has paid the manufacturer battery fee for a lead-acid battery and later 
receives an untimely statement from a manufacturer that the fee has been paid for that lead-acid battery may file a claim for refund for any overpaid fees.
Manufacturer’s Battery Fee Permit Verification
Beginning January 1, 2020, the CDTFA can disclose the name, account number, and 
account status of a manufacturer battery fee account. To verify a CDTFA permit, license, or account, please visit our website at https://services.cdtfa.ca.gov/webservices/verification.jsp . 
The CDTFA may also disclose to the importer the amount of fees paid by the manufacturer, according to their agreement.
Your return will be updated to reflect these legislative changes beginning with the first 
quarter 2020 reporting period.

Prepaid MTS Surcharge Law Declared Unenforceable:  
Effective January 1, 2019, Service Suppliers Must Collect the 
Emergency Telephone Users (911) Surcharge on Charges for 
Prepaid Intrastate Telephone Services
On November 15, 2018, the United States District Court, Northern District of California ( MetroPCS California, 
LLC v. Michael Picker et al, case number 17-cv-05959-SI ) enjoined state agencies from enforcing the provisions 
of the Prepaid Mobile Telephony Services (MTS) Surcharge Collection Act because it conflicts with federal 
law. A notice of appeal of the district court’s decision was filed on December 14, 2018, but a judicial stay of the injunction was not requested, thereby ending CDTFA ’s enforcement of the prepaid MTS surcharge program. Therefore, service suppliers of prepaid MTS must now collect the Emergency Telephone Users (911) Surcharge (ETUS) on all charges for intrastate telecommunication service including VoIP and wireless services. 
Backg
round
Be
ginning January 1, 2016, a prepaid MTS surcharge was imposed on purchasers of prepaid MTS based upon 
the sales price of each retail transaction in this state. Sellers of prepaid MTS were required to register with the CDTFA and charge and collect the prepaid MTS surcharge from their customers at the time of the retail sale. The prepaid MTS surcharge was in lieu of charges imposed pursuant to the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act (Part 20, commencing with Revenue and Taxation Code section 41001) for prepaid MTS.
P
repaid MTS Service Suppliers
G
enerally, service suppliers must collect the ETUS on all charges for intrastate telecommunication service, 
including VoIP and wireless services (prepaid and postpaid). Effective January 1, 2019, prepaid MTS service suppliers shall report and pay the ETUS on charges for prepaid and postpaid intrastate telecommunication services in the same manner as they did prior to January 1, 2016. 
The Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Return will be converted to a single-column return with updated 
filing instructions for reporting periods beginning January 2019. As a service supplier, you will continue to 
file your ETUS returns with the CDTFA and pay the ETUS surcharge collected from your customers on both prepaid and postpaid charges for intrastate telecommunication services. 
C
alculating the Intrastate Portion of Charges for Services Subject to the ETUS 
A service supplier is permitted to choose between two (or three for a VoIP service supplier) optional methods for calculating their exempt interstate portion of its charges that in turn provide the intrastate portion of their charges subject to the ETUS surcharge. For each type of service supplied by the service supplier, an election must be made at least once for one of the optional methods. For additional information, please refer to form, 
CDTFA-501-TEA,  Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge — Exempt Interstate Revenue Election Form . 
L-593 (12-18)Sellers of Prepaid MTS
S
ellers of prepaid MTS that are currently registered with the CDTFA will be advised to stop collecting the 
Prepaid MTS Surcharge from their customers on their sales of prepaid MTS effective immediately. Please 
note that local charges still apply to the sale of prepaid MTS in jurisdictions that impose a utility user tax on charges for access to communication services or to local “911” emergency telephone systems.

Special Notice
New Electronic Logging Device Requirement 
Can Help Support Interstate or Foreign Commerce 
Exemption for Trucks and Trailers
The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) now requires interstate motor carriers 
and truck drivers to use electronic logging devices (ELD) to keep records on driving time, mileage, and other service hour data. Although, the DOT only requires ELD records be retained for six months, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) encourages you to keep your ELD records for at least eight years. 
Interstate or foreign commerce exemption for trucks or trailers
Generally, use tax applies to trucks or trailers when purchased and first used out-of-state by 
California residents, and subsequently brought into California within the first 12 months of ownership. However, your truck or trailer purchase may qualify for an exemption from use tax if you purchased it and primarily used it in interstate or foreign commerce. To qualify  for this exemption:
• You must take delivery of the truck or trailer outside of California.
• You must first functionally use the truck or trailer outside of California, prior to its
initial entry into California; and
• One-half or more of the miles traveled by your truck or trailer during the six-month
period immediately following its first entry into California must have been commercial
miles traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.
If you purchased a truck or trailer without completing registration and paying the use tax to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), you still need to report your purchase to the CDTFA and file a CDTFA-401-CUTS , Combined State and Local Consumer Use Tax Return 
for Vehicle . You do not need to wait until the end of the six-month test period to register with 
the CDTFA. You can register and file your return at any time and we will contact you at the end of the six-month test period to request the documents supporting your interstate or foreign commerce exemption.
What records should I keep?
To support that your truck or trailer was primarily used in interstate or foreign commerce, 
you should keep the following records for a minimum of eight years:
• The purchase contract.
• A statement signed by the seller verifying the truck or trailer was delivered to you
outside of California.
• A load confirmation, bill of lading, or other similar document verifying the truck or
trailer was first functionally used outside of California. Please note: Functional use
means use for the purposes for which the vehicle was designed.  For a commercial truckor trailer, first functional use occurs when the truck or trailer first hauls cargo or is firstdispatched to pick up a specific load of cargo.

• Any bills of lading and driver logs, fuel receipts, and other similar documents verifying
the location and use of your truck or trailer and the origin and destination of each load
from the date of out-of-state delivery until the truck or trailer first entered California.Records should continue for the six month period after entering California.

during this six-month test period.  Although, DOT only requires ELD records be retained for six months, you should keep 
your ELD records for eight years because CDTFA may have up to eight years to determine whether your truck or trailer was actually purchased for use in interstate or foreign commerce.

R&TC section 6377.1 generally provides a partial exemption from the sales and use tax for 
persons that: 
•	 Are primarily engaged in specified types of business, referred to as a “qualified person,” 
•	 Purchase or lease “qualified tangible personal property,” and 
•	 Primarily use the “qualified tangible personal property” in a qualified manner.

property” to include special purpose buildings and foundations used as an integral part of the generation or production or storage and distribution of electric power. 
3. Beginning January 1, 2018, expands the definition of a “qualified person” to include 
businesses primarily engaged in operating electric power generation facilities, as described in the North American Industry Classification System, 2012 edition, (NAICS) codes 22111 to 221118, inclusive, or primarily engaged in electric power distribution as described in NAICS code 221122. 
4. Beginning January 1, 2018, removes the exclusion from the definition of a “qualified

5. Amends the definition of “useful life” to state that tangible personal property that is 
deducted on the California state franchise or income tax return under R&TC sections 17201 and 17255 or section 24356, is deemed to have a useful life of one or more years.

Amendments 
to the Manufacturing and R&D Partial Exemption You may be eligible for a refund or a cancellation of a billing under amended “useful life” definition 
If you are a “qualified person” that received a billing (referred to as a notice of determination 
[NOD]) for qualified property that was purchased or leased on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2018, on the basis that the partial exemption does not apply because you deducted the property under R&TC sections 17201 and 17255 or section 24356, then you may be eligible to have the NOD cancelled and you may be eligible for a refund of payments made under the NOD. However, you, as the qualified person, must make a request for the cancellation or refund to the CDTFA by June 30, 2018.

CANNABIS
SPECIAL NOTICECalifornia Department of Tax and Fee Administration
Important Information for Cannabis Distributors
As a cannabis distributor, you must electronically file your cannabis tax returns and pay the cultivation tax and cannabis 
excise tax due to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). Below is an overview of the reporting and invoicing requirements for cannabis distributors as well as information on how to avoid substantial penalties for failure to pay the cannabis taxes due.
Cannabis tax return
As a cannabis distributor, you are required to electronically report and pay both the cultivation tax and cannabis excise tax on your cannabis tax return. The cannabis tax return filing and payment of the cannabis taxes are due April 30, 2018, for the first quarter reporting period (January 1, 2018, through March 31, 2018).
You may request to file your returns and pay the cannabis taxes on a monthly basis instead of quarterly beginning  
April 1, 2018. To request a monthly reporting period, call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711) and select Special Taxes and Fees from the menu. If your request for a monthly reporting period is approved, please remember that the return and payment of the cannabis taxes are due on the last day of the month following each reporting period. 
Reporting the cultivation tax
The cultivation tax must be reported:
 • For the reporting period in which the cannabis or cannabis products enter the commercial market. •  In ounces, including partial ounces rounded to the nearest hundredth, based on the category of dried flowers, dried 
leaves, or fresh cannabis plant as listed on the invoice from the original cultivator, less any cannabis that was used 
for testing.
  - You are required to enter adult-use ounces separately from medicinal ounces for each category. 
  -  You will need to obtain additional information from manufacturers on the category and ounces of cannabis used to 
manufacture the cannabis products to report the cultivation tax properly.
Reporting the cannabis excise tax
The cannabis excise tax must be reported: • For the reporting period in which you sell or transfer the cannabis or cannabis products to the cannabis retailer.  -  For example, the total average market price of your sales or transfers within the first quarter of 2018  
(January 1, 2018, through March 31, 2018) must be reported on the first quarter 2018 return.  
 • Based on the average market price of the cannabis or cannabis products.    -  When you calculate the average market price in an arm’s length transaction (retailer’s wholesale cost plus the 
mark-up determined by the CDTFA, currently 60 percent), you are not required to reconcile the average market 
price you calculate with the retailer’s actual retail selling price.  
 •  As “excess excise tax collected” on your cannabis tax return if the tax is collected from retailers for any inventory they 
purchased prior  to January 1, 2018, and sold at retail on or after January 1, 2018.
  -  For these types of transactions, the retailer will collect the cannabis excise tax from their customers and pay the 
amount collected to you, a cannabis distributor.
  -  For specific invoice requirements related to these types of transactions, please see our Tax Guide for Cannabis 
Businesses  at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.ht m.L-531 (2-18)Invoicing requirements for the cannabis taxes 
As a cannabis distributor, you must properly document the amount of the cultivation tax and the cannabis excise tax 
you collect. When collecting the cultivation tax from cultivators or manufacturers, or the cannabis excise tax from retailers, you must provide an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that contains the following:
 • Your name, as the distributor. • The name of the other licensee (that is, the cultivator, manufacturer, retailer). • The associated unique identifier for the cannabis or cannabis product. • The amount of cannabis tax collected. • The date of the sale or transfer.These invoices or receipts serve as verification to cultivators, manufacturers, and retailers that the cannabis taxes were 
paid to a distributor and relieves them of their cannabis taxes liability.
50 percent penalty for failure to pay the cannabis taxes due
In general, the law imposes a 10 percent penalty on taxpayers and feepayers for failure to timely pay the tax or fee due, or for filing a late return. In addition to these 10 percent penalties, the cannabis tax law imposes a mandatory 50 percent penalty for failure to pay the cultivation tax or cannabis excise tax due. Therefore, it is very important that you report and pay the cannabis taxes on or before the due date for each reporting period.
You may be relieved of the penalties assessed, including the 50 percent penalty, if the CDTFA finds that your failure to 
timely pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond your control, and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect. In order to be relieved of the mandatory penalties assessed, including the 50 percent penalty for failure to pay the cannabis taxes, you, as the cannabis distributor, must file an online request for relief of the penalty by filing a statement with the CDTFA, signed under penalty of perjury, which states the facts upon which the request for penalty relief is based. You may request relief of penalty by visiting our Online Services  page at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/services /, and following the directions under the Request Relief  tab.
Sales and use tax return
If you make sales of tangible personal property, you are required to hold a seller’s permit. As a cannabis distributor, you are responsible for electronically filing both  your sales and use tax return and your cannabis tax return by the filing due 
dates. You must still file a sales and use tax return by the due date even if you do not make taxable sales (for example, all your sales are for resale). If you sell cannabis or cannabis products for resale to other licensees, make sure the purchaser gives you a timely and valid resale certificate. For more information regarding sales for resale, please see our publication 103, Sales for Resale, at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/pub103 /. 
The CDTFA’s online guide, Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses , is your best resource
Not all requirements for the cannabis industry can be addressed within one single special notice. For more comprehensive information, we encourage you to read our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/
industry/cannabis.htm  which has separate tabs with important information, including videos, for distributors, retailers, 
cultivators, and manufacturers. If you have additional questions, you may call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711) Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.

711 New Reporting Requirement for Sales 
of Jet Fuel at Airport Locations 
Beginning January 1, 2020, if you are a retailer of aviation fuel or jet fuel, you must report 
your sales of fuel by airport location. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) adopted a rule clarifcation limiting the proceeds from taxes imposed on jet fuel by state and local governments to airport-related expenses. With this new rule in effect, aviation and jet fuel retailers are required to report their sales of jet fuel by airport location. 
Ne
w Reporting Requirement 
I
f you are a retailer of jet fuel at an airport, you will need to track and report your sales of 
jet fuel by airport location on a new supplementary form called CDTFA-531-JF, Aircraft Jet Fuel Retailers – Sales by Airport Location, for return periods beginning January 1, 2020. When fling your customary fuel retailer’s return online, you will be prompted to complete this form automatically. You will report the amounts of jet fuel sold by airport location, including total taxable jet fuel sales and the amount of tax collected. The return will also include a separate line for taxable sales of jet fuel at non-airport locations. Reporting an amount on the new form will not change any other part of your return. You will continue to report your transactions as you currently do and also report them on the new form for jet fuel sales. 
Ba

O
n November 7, 2014, the FAA published fnal amendments to its policy on federal requirements 
for the use of proceeds from taxes on aviation fuel ( Fed. Reg. 66282, Nov. 7, 2014 ). Under 
federal law, generally, airport operators that have accepted federal assistance may use airport revenues only for airport-related purposes. State and local taxes on jet fuel are also subject to these airport revenue use requirements. An airport operator or state government that submits an application for funding under the Federal Airport Improvement Program must provide assurance that revenues from state and local government taxes on aviation fuel will be used for certain aviation-related purposes only, including airport capital and operating costs and state aviation programs.

cannabis or cannabis products the retailer purchased prior  to January 1, 2018. Cannabis retailers are required 
to pay the cannabis excise tax to a cannabis distributor. Cannabis cultivators owe the cultivation tax on all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market on or after January 1, 2018. The cultivation tax does not apply to harvested cannabis a cultivator transferred or sold prior to January 1, 2018. Cultivators are required to pay the cultivation tax to a distributor or manufacturer. 
Cannabis excise tax must be paid to cannabis distributors 
On and after January 1, 2018, distributors who sell or transfer cannabis or cannabis products to a cannabis retailer are required to collect the cannabis excise tax from the retailer. In addition, cannabis retailers, who acquired cannabis or cannabis products prior to January 1, 2018, upon which they did not pay the cannabis 
excise tax to a distributor, must collect the 15 percent cannabis excise tax from their customers. Retailers must pay the excise tax on those sales by the 15th of the following month in which they collected the tax to a licensed cannabis distributor with whom they have a business relationship (that is, a distributor that they purchase or acquire cannabis or cannabis products from on or after January 1, 2018). 
Cannabis retailer – collecting and invoicing requirements 
As a cannabis retailer, you are not required to separately state the cannabis excise tax on your receipt or invoice to your customer, but you must include the following statement, “The cannabis excise taxes are included in the total amount of the invoice.” The cannabis excise tax is imposed on the purchaser as 15 percent of the average market price. 
To calculate the cannabis excise tax due on your retail sales of cannabis or cannabis products that you acquired 
prior to January 1, 2018, you must multiply the average market price by the 15 percent excise tax rate. For information on how to determine the average market price, please see our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm. 
Your sales of cannabis and cannabis products are generally subject to sales tax. The sales tax is due on the retail selling price of cannabis or cannabis products, including the cannabis excise tax. 
Cultivation tax not due on cannabis transferred or sold prior to January 1, 2018 
As a reminder, cannabis cultivators are required to pay the cultivation tax to a distributor or manufacturer on all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market beginning January 1, 2018. However, the cultivation tax is not due on harvested cannabis transferred or sold to distributors or manufacturers prior to January 1, 2018, even if entry into the commercial market (completes testing and complies with quality assurance review) occurs after that date. Manufacturers and distributors must maintain documentation to support that the cannabis was transferred or sold from a cultivator prior to January 1, 2018.  
 
 
 
 
  Cannabis distributors – invoicing and recordkeeping requirements 
Cannabis distributors must properly document the amount of cannabis excise tax collected. If you are a cannabis 
distributor and you collect the cannabis excise tax from retailers for cannabis or cannabis products the retailer acquired prior to January 1, 2018, you must provide the retailer an invoice, receipt, or other similar document that contains all of the following: 
• The invoice date. 
• Your name and seller’s permit number, or if you are not required to hold a seller’s permit because you do not make sales, you must include a statement to that effect on the receipt. 
• Name of the cannabis retailer and the retailer’s seller’s permit number. 
• The amount of cannabis excise tax collected. 
As a distributor, you should keep accurate records of your commercial cannabis activity. This includes retaining records to support when the cannabis was transferred or sold to you from a cultivator or manufacturer, or when you sell or transfer to a retailer, and the amount of cultivation tax and excise taxes collected. 
The CDTFA’s online guide, Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses , is your best resource

New Tax Rate on Other Tobacco Products Effective 
July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) recently 
approved the new tax rate of 59.27 percent effective July 1, 2019 through 
June 30, 2020. Tobacco products distributors are required to apply this rate 
to all distributions of other tobacco products during the effective period.
Annually, the CDTFA is required to determine a tax rate on other tobacco 
products (products other than cigarettes) that is equivalent to the combined 
tax rate imposed on cigarettes. Tobacco products distributors pay this tax upon the distribution of tobacco products in California.
The tobacco products tax is due at the time the tobacco products are 
distributed in California and is based on the distributor’s wholesale cost, the cost of the tobacco products to the distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances (see Revenue and Taxation Code section 30017 and Regulation 4076 ). This cost is typically the invoiced price of the tobacco 
products charged by a manufacturer or importer to the licensed distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances. Accordingly, the tax rate that 
applies is the rate in effect at the time the tobacco product is sold by the distributor.  You may find current and historical tobacco products tax rates 
on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm .
For more information regarding cigarette and tobacco products taxes, see our online Tax Guide for Cigarette and Tobacco Products  at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cigarette-and-tobacco-products.htm , or call 
our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711) Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays; from the main menu, select Special Taxes and Fees.

Page 1Reminders for Cannabis Distributors and Retailers 
New Responsibilities for Cannabis Retailers 
Beginning January 1, 2023
Distributor Sales or Transfers to a Cannabis Retailer before January 1, 2023
Distributors must continue to collect the cannabis excise tax from cannabis retailers for cannabis or cannabis 
products sold or transferred to a cannabis retailer before January 1, 2023, based on the average market price of cannabis or cannabis products. 
• The average market price in an arm’s length transaction is the retailer’s wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products plus a mark-up determined by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). The mark-up rate is 75 percent through the end of 2022. 
• Distributors must provide cannabis retailers with an invoice or receipt that indicates, among other requirements, the amount of cannabis excise tax. 
• Distributors must also report and pay the cannabis excise tax to CDTFA for cannabis or cannabis products sold or transferred to a cannabis retailer before January 1, 2023.
Cannabis Retailer Purchases before January 1, 2023
Cannabis retailers must continue to pay the cannabis excise tax to the distributor that sold or transferred cannabis or cannabis products to that retailer before January 1, 2023. Through the end of 2022, the cannabis excise tax will continue to be based on the average market price. 
• The average market price in an arm’s length transaction is the retailer’s wholesale cost plus the CDTFA determined mark-up. The mark-up rate is 75 percent through the end of 2022. 
• For retail sales of cannabis or cannabis products made before January 1, 2023, retailers must collect the cannabis excise tax from purchasers on the retail sale based on the average market price of the cannabis or cannabis products.
• Retailers should keep documentation, such as invoices or receipts, that show the cannabis excise tax was paid to a distributor and collected from the purchaser on the retail sale. Without such documentation, CDTFA may hold a cannabis retailer liable for the cannabis excise tax. 
New Responsibilities for Cannabis Retailers Beginning January 1, 2023
In December, CDTFA will automatically register cannabis retailers for a cannabis retailer excise tax permit based on their licensing information with the Department of Cannabis Control. Our online services  will be available for 
cannabis retailers to register in mid-December. Additional information will be provided in November.L-869 (9-22) Page 2For retail sales of cannabis or cannabis products made on and after January 1, 2023, cannabis retailers must 
collect the 15 percent cannabis excise tax from purchasers based on the gross receipts from the retail sale of 
cannabis or cannabis products. 
• Gross receipts include the sales price of the cannabis or cannabis products and all charges related to the sale, 
such as delivery fees and any local cannabis taxes listed separately on the invoice or receipt to the purchaser. 
Gross receipts for cannabis excise tax purposes do not include sales tax. 
• Cannabis retailers must file cannabis retailer excise tax returns and pay the cannabis excise tax collected 
from purchasers to CDTFA. The first cannabis retailer excise tax return will be due May 1, 2023, for the 
January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2023, reporting period. 
• Cannabis retailers may claim a credit on their cannabis retailer excise tax return for cannabis excise tax paid to 
a distributor for cannabis sold or transferred to the retailer before January 1, 2023, and sold at retail on or after 
January 1, 2023. 
• Cannabis retailers must keep documentation to support any credits reported on their cannabis retailer excise 
tax return. Without proper documentation, the claimed credit may be disallowed. CDTFA may hold the cannabis 
retailer liable for any unpaid cannabis excise tax.
We encourage you to read our online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm , 
for more information about the upcoming changes.

same location where cigarettes and tobacco products are sold or stored.
CDTFA conducts routine inspections to ensure businesses are complying with California’s laws governing the 
sales of items such as cannabis, cannabis products, cigarettes, and tobacco products. We also verify that all appropriate excise taxes are documented and paid. These inspections protect consumers by ensuring only legal and regulated products are sold in this state. 
What’s new starting January 1, 2024
•We may inspect any business selling or storing items of any kind bearing the universal cannabis symbol.
•We will consider any item or product incorrectly bearing the universal cannabis symbol as contraband, and itwill be seized.
•Each individual package, label, advertisement, or other document or object misusing the universal cannabissymbol is a separate violation of MAUCRSA.
•You must maintain records to establish the use or possession of items bearing the universal cannabis symbol isin connection with a licensed commercial cannabis activity.
•You must make records available to us upon request.

Collection of 9 11 Surcharge Required by 
Sellers Beginning January 1, 2020; 
Collection of Local Charges by Sellers 
Extended through December 31, 2020
According to recently enacted Senate Bill (SB) 96 (Stats. 2019, ch. 54)1, sellers of prepaid 
mobile telephony services (MTS) are required to collect, report, and pay the Emergency 
Telephone Users (911) Surcharge on each retail transaction of prepaid MTS effective 
January 1, 2020. SB 344 (Stats. 2019 , ch. 642)2 was also recently enacted and extends 
the Local Prepaid MTS Collection Act, which requires sellers of prepaid MTS to collect 
applicable local charges on their sales of prepaid MTS through December 31, 2020. Sellers 
of prepaid MTS (other than service suppliers) are required to have an active prepaid MTS 
account to collect, report, and pay both the 9 11 Surcharge and applicable local charges as 
explained b elow.
C
hanges in Law Affecting Sellers of Prepaid MTS
In December 20183, we informed sellers of prepaid MTS that a federal court declared 
the provisions of the Prepaid MTS Surcharge Collection Act unenforceable. Therefore, 
sellers were only required to collect the applicable local charges on their sales of prepaid 
MTS. Due to this new legislation, beginning January 1, 2020, sellers must collect the 9 11 
Su
rcharge in addition to the applicable local charges they were already collecting.
911 Surcharge R ate
The 9 11 Surcharge is a flat rate of no more than $0.80 cents per transaction as determined 
a
nnually by the Office of Emergency Services (OES). You will be provided a separate notice 
when OES establishes the rate for the upcoming calendar year. If you make retail sales of 
prepaid MTS in this state, you must collect, report, and pay the 9 11 Surcharge on each 
retail transaction at the time of sale, regardless of the transaction amount or whether the 
prepaid MTS sold is combined with other items or services not subject to sales and use tax. 
Local C harges C ollection R eq uirements E xtended
I
f you sell prepaid MTS at your retail location(s) in areas with an applicable local charge or you 
make sales online or remotely to California customers in areas with local charges and your 
re
tail sales of prepaid MTS are more than $15,000 in the prior calendar year, you must continue 
to collect the local charges on your sales of prepaid MTS through December 31, 2020. Sellers 
of prepaid MTS may retain up to two percent (2%) (not including the 9 11 Surcharge) of the 
local c harges c ollected a s reimbursement c osts for collecting t he lo cal charges.  The electronic 
prepaid MTS return includes instructions on how to claim the 2% reimbursement. You can

of each year, based on the percentage change in the California Consumer Price Index, as calculated by the Department of Finance.

Donated Medicinal Cannabis Exempt from Taxes 
Beginning March 1, 2020, California law provides that cannabis retailers may donate free medicinal cannabis or medicinal 
cannabis products (medicinal cannabis) to medicinal cannabis patients, or cannabis licensees may donate free medicinal cannabis to cannabis retailers for subsequent donation to medicinal cannabis patients, without payment of certain taxes (see Senate Bill 34 ). 
What taxes will not apply to donated medicinal cannabis? 
• The cultivation tax  will not apply to medicinal cannabis when the cultivator designates for donation in the California 
Cannabis Track-and-Trace system. 
• The cannabis excise tax does not apply when a cannabis retailer donates free medicinal cannabis to a medicinal 
cannabis patient. 
• The use tax will not apply when a cannabis retailer donates free medicinal cannabis to a medicinal cannabis patient, 
or when another licensee, such as a distributor or manufacturer, donates free medicinal cannabis to a retailer for 
subsequent donation to a medicinal cannabis patient. 
Who qualifes as a medicinal cannabis patient? 
A medicinal cannabis patient is a qualifed patient who possesses a qualifying physician’s recommendation, or a qualifed 
patient or the patient’s primary caregiver with a valid Medical Marijuana Identifcation Card issued by the California Department of Public Health. 
How do you certify that the medicinal cannabis will be donated? 
The cannabis licensee that receives medicinal cannabis for donation must certify in writing to the licensee donating it that 
the medicinal cannabis will ultimately be donated to a medicinal cannabis patient. Cannabis licensees may use a written document, such as a letter, note, purchase order, or preprinted form, as a cannabis donation certifcate. Or, a cannabis licensee may use CDTFA-230-CD, Cannabis Donation Certifcate  as a written certifcation that the medicinal cannabis will 
be donated to a medicinal cannabis patient. The CDTFA-230-CD is available on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/formspubs/cdtfa230cd.pdf . 
When taken in good faith by the licensee donating the medicinal cannabis, the written certifcation relieves: 
• The cultivator from the liability of the cultivation tax. 
• The manufacturer from its responsibility to collect the cultivation tax from the cultivator. 
• The distributor from its responsibility to collect the cultivation tax from the cultivator and the cannabis excise tax from 
the retailer. 
• Each licensee from liability of the use tax when donating the medicinal cannabis. 
If a cannabis licensee certifes in writing that medicinal cannabis will be donated to a medicinal cannabis patient and later 
sells or uses the medicinal cannabis in some other manner than for donation, the certifying licensee will be liable for any taxes that would be due, including the cultivation tax, cannabis excise tax, and use tax. 
For more information 
We encourage you to read our online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm .

L-831Hazardous Waste Generation and Handling Fee  
Application of Fee, Payments, and New Rate 
Effective January 1, 2022
A new law repeals the Hazardous Waste Generator Fee and replaces it with a new 
Generation and Handling Fee. ( Senate Bill 158 ; Stats. 2021, ch.73)
New generation and handling fee and fee application
The generator fee is repealed as of January 1, 2022, and a new generation and handling fee is effective January 1, 2022. Some important changes include:
• The generation and handling fee applies to each hazardous waste generation site that generates five (5) or more tons of hazardous waste per calendar year or portion of the calendar year.
• The rate of the generation and handling fee is $49.25 per ton or fraction of a ton.
• Imported waste, that was not subject to the generator fee, is now subject to the generation and handling fee.
New payment requirements
You must pay the generation and handling fee for each reporting period (for example, calendar year 2022), based on waste generated in the prior calendar year (for example, 2021), in two equal payments as noted below:
• The prepayment due date is November 30, 2022 (and each subsequent year).
• The final payment and return due date is February 28, 2023 (and each subsequent year).
Reminder: You are still required to file and pay your 2021 Hazardous Waste Generator Fee Return by February 28, 2022.
Generation and handling fee exemptions 
All of the generator fee exemptions remain the same for the generation and handling fee, except for those listed below. The following activities are not exempt  from the generation 
and handling fee:
• The generation or disposal of hazardous waste by local vector control agencies or by county agricultural commissioners, if the wastes result from their control or regulatory activities.
• The generation or disposal of hazardous waste due to the removal of a tank from an owner-occupied single family residential property that was acquired without knowledge that there is a tank containing hazardous waste.
• The generation of five or more tons of hazardous waste by facility operators at any site during a calendar year who have paid a hazardous waste facility fee or who have received a credit. 
Your generation and handling fee supports California
We collect the hazardous waste generation and handling fee on behalf of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). This fee supports the protection of California’s communities and the environment from toxic contamination, and also helps DTSC promote the use of safer consumer products. DECEMBER 2021

REQUEST FOR RELIEF FROM PENALTY,  CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION  
COLLECTION COST RECOVERY FEE,   
AND/OR INTEREST
TAXPAYER NAME  ACCOUNT NUMBER
To obtain relief from penalty, interest, or the collection cost recovery fee, you must file a written request with the California Department 
of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). Your signature under penalty of perjury is required unless you are seeking relief due to a disaster or declared California State of Emergency. Please attach documentation to support your request. We may contact you if we need additional information. If you make any payments towards the amount(s) for which you are requesting relief, you must generally file a timely claim for refund either within three years after the due date of the return, within six months from the date of each payment, or within six months from the date a determination becomes final (whichever period expires later), or you will lose the opportunity to obtain a refund of the amount(s) paid. 
Publication 117 , Filing a Claim for Refund , contains information regarding refunds, 
including CDTFA-101 , Claim for Refund or Credit . This is one of many publications available on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov .
I request relief from: (please select one or more applicable options below)
PENALTY
We may grant relief from penalty charges if we determine that you did not timely file or pay, or did not pay using the correct payment method such as electronic funds transfer (EFT), due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond your control. Your request may not be processed until the tax or fee has been paid in full. If we relieve you of the penalty charges, you must still pay the interest due on any late return payments and prepayments or billings issued.
COLLECTION COST RECOVERY FEE
A collection cost recovery fee (CRF) is applied to most past due liabilities that remain unpaid for more than 90 days. We may grant relief from the CRF if we determine that you did not pay a past due liability due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond your control. We cannot process your request until the liability for which the CRF was assessed has been paid in full (tax or fee, interest, and penalty).
INTEREST
We may grant relief of interest only for the reasons shown below. If we approve your request, we may relieve all or part of the interest.
•  You did not pay tax in whole or in part due to an unreasonable error or delay by a CDTF A team member acting in their official 
capacity , and no significant aspect of the error or delay was attributable to your actions or inactions ; or
•  You did not pay sales or use tax as a direct result of an error or delay by a state agency that collects the tax on behalf of 
CDTF A, and no significant aspect of the error or delay is attributable to your actions or inactions .
PENALTY AND INTEREST—DISASTER VICTIMS
We may grant relief from penalty and interest charges if we determine that you did not timely file or pay, or did not pay using the correct payment method (such as EFT), due to a disaster or declared California State of Emergency and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect. 
I request relief for the period(s)  because:
Please write the specific tax period(s) [Example: 4Q23, 1Q24] above and enter the reasons for your request below .
(additional writing space on reverse side)
CERTIFICATION
I certify (or declare), under penalty of perjury, under the laws of the State of California, that the foregoing is true and correct. If I am 
requesting relief of interest, I also certify that my actions or inactions did not significantly contribute to the error or delay .

711Consumer Designation for Qualified All-Volunteer Fire 
Departments is Extended through January 1, 2026
Recently enacted legislation, Senate Bill 38  (Stats. 2020, ch. 78), extends through 
January 1, 2026, the consumer designation for qualified all-volunteer fire departments 
established by Senate Bill 598  (Stats. 2015, ch. 248). Generally, these qualified fire 
departments are not required to have a seller’s permit or file sales and use tax returns to report sales of merchandise (tangible personal property), including clothing and hot prepared food products, when the profits are used solely and exclusively to further the departments’ purposes. Instead, they are considered the consumers of the items sold. As consumers, tax applies when the qualified fire departments purchase the items to sell.
Who Qualifies?
To qualify, an “all-volunteer fire department” must meet all  of the following requirements:
• Members may be unpaid, paid hourly, or per incident, but cannot be paid a regular 
salary;
• The department’s purpose is to protect the lives, property, and environment within a designated geographical area from fires, disasters, and emergency incidents through education, prevention, training, and emergency response;
• The department is regularly organized for volunteer fire department purposes;
• The department qualifies as a tax-exempt nonprofit organization; and
• The department’s gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property in each of the two preceding calendar years is less than $100,000.
For More Information
Additional information can be found on our Tax Guide for Nonprofit  Organizations  at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/nonprofit-organizations.htm . The guide will be updated as more 
information becomes available.

L-851 (5-22)Cannabis Markup Rate Decreases to  
75 Percent on July 1, 2022
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) is responsible for determining the cannabis 
markup rate every six months. This rate is the markup between the wholesale cost and the retail selling price and is based on statewide market data. For the period commencing July 1, 2022, and ending December 31, 2022, the markup rate will be 75 percent.  
The markup rate is used to compute the average market price of cannabis or cannabis products sold or 
transferred to a cannabis retailer by a distributor in an arm’s length transaction . In these transactions, the average 
market price, which is subject to the state’s 15 percent cannabis excise tax, is the cannabis retailer’s wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products plus the CDTFA’s calculated markup rate. 
All current and prior cannabis markup rates are available under Cannabis Taxes  on our Tax Rates – Special Taxes 
and Fees webpage at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm . We also encourage you to read our 
online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm , for information about 
cannabis taxes and examples on how to calculate the average market price using CDTFA’s markup rate.

711 New Operative Date of April 25, 2019, for District Use Tax 
Collection Requirement Based on $500,000 Sales Threshold 
The California Legislature recently passed Senate Bill (SB) 92 (Stats. 2019, ch. 34), which 
changes the operative date of the new district use tax collection requirement based on a $500,000 sales threshold from April 1, 2019 to April 25, 2019. As explained in our prior Special Notice L-632 ¹, under the new law, all retailers are required to collect and remit the 
district use tax on all sales made for delivery in any district that imposes a district tax if, during the preceding or current calendar year the total combined sales of tangible personal property in this state or for delivery in this state by the retailer and all persons related to the retailer exceed $500,000. 
Assembly Bill (AB) 147 (Stats. 2019, ch. 5) established the new district use tax collection 
requirement with an operative date of April 1, 2019, and was signed into law on April 25, 2019. Changing the operative date to April 25, 2019, therefore, eliminates the retroactive effect of AB 147 with regard to the new district use tax collection requirement. 
Please note that SB 92 does not change the operative date of the new state  use tax 
collection requirement based on $500,000 in combined sales for delivery in California. The 
operative date of the new state use tax collection requirement is still April 1, 2019. 
What are district taxes? 
District taxes are voter-approved transactions (sales) and use taxes imposed by cities, 
counties, and other local jurisdictions. The current statewide California sales and use tax rate is 7.25 percent. In areas where a district tax is imposed (taxing district), the total tax rate includes the statewide rate plus the district tax rate(s). 
Who is responsible for paying the district tax? 
District sales  taxes are due from retailers on their sales of tangible personal property and 
district use  taxes are due from purchasers for their use of tangible personal property in 
a taxing district. However, a retailer that is “engaged in business” in a taxing district is 
generally required to collect the district’s use tax and pay it to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) on sales of tangible personal property delivered in the district. For more information on being engaged in business in a district, see publication 44², District Taxes (Sales and Use Taxes) . 
New operative date for new district use tax collection requirement 
If you exceeded the $500,000 district use tax collection sales threshold in calendar year 
2018 or during the period from January 1, 2019, through April 24, 2019, then starting on April 25, 2019, you were considered engaged in business in every district imposing a district tax and are required to collect, report, and pay the district use tax to the CDTFA on all sales

Special Notice 
New Operative Date of 
April 25, 2019, for District Use Tax Collection Requirement Based on $500,000 Sales Threshold made for delivery in those districts. You are not responsible for collecting, reporting, and 
paying the district use tax to the CDTFA on sales made for delivery in a taxing district prior to April 25, 2019, unless you were otherwise engaged in business in that district. However, if you have already collected district use tax from your customers on sales made prior to April 25, 2019, either at the time of the sale or at a later date, you must report and pay the collected tax amounts to the CDTFA on your sales and use tax return. 
If you are otherwise engaged in business in a district, your responsibility to collect and 
pay the district use tax is not affected by the new collection requirement or the change in operative date, and you should continue to collect, report, and pay the district tax on all sales made for delivery into that district(s).

Return Update and Information for Used Vehicle Dealers
Return Update Legislation that went into effect January 1, 2021, requires used vehicle dealers to provide detailed vehicle sales information when filing their sales and use tax returns. Many dealers are also required to pay the tax on vehicle sales directly to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). In an effort to assist in the reconciliation process for tax paid to the DMV, starting April 1, 2022, please include the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for all vehicles sold when filing your CDTFA-531-MV, Used Vehicle Dealers Sales Report
1.  A revision to CDTFA-531-MV is being made to add a new column 
for you to furnish VINs beginning with your March 2022 return which is due May 2, 2022. This will be in addition to the transaction information you are currently reporting. Adding this information will alleviate some of the difficulties dealers have encountered when filing returns after paying the tax directly to the DMV.
Reporting Sales in the Proper Reporting Period
Sales reported to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) should be reported on your sales and use tax return in the month when the sale occurs and not when the payment for the vehicle is received or when the registration and tax is paid to the DMV (certain dealers are required to pay tax to the DMV). Tax is due based on an accrual basis and not on a cash basis. For example, if you make a sale in February, receive payment from your customer in March, and register and/or pay the tax to the DMV in March, you must report the February sale on your February sales and use tax return and not  on your March return. Tax payments made to the DMV will be applied to your sales and use 
tax return in the period in which the sale is made (based on the Report of Sale date).
You Must Include Additional Taxable Charges on Your Sales and Use Tax Return
The DMV only collects the tax on the vehicle sales price and not on other taxable charges such as document fees, smog certification fees, mandatory warranties, etc. While you are required to provide the Vehicle Selling Price Reported to DMV for each vehicle sold on CDTFA-531-MV, you should not include additional charges on this form. However, you are required to report the additional charges, along with your vehicle sales, on your sales and use tax return on line 1, Total Sales. For example, you paid tax to the DMV based on the selling price of the vehicle. You also charged your customer a fee for the preparation of documents (doc fee), which is a taxable charge made in connection with the sale of the vehicle. You must report both the sales price of the vehicle and the doc fee on line 1 of your sales and use tax return. 
For more information on how tax applies to some additional common charges made by motor vehicle dealers, please see 
the Special Charges Related to Motor Vehicle Sales section in our Tax Guide for Motor Vehicle Dealers at  
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/used-vehicle-dealers.htm#SpecialCharges . For help completing CDTFA-531-MV, a  
video tutorial is available on our Online Services webpage at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/services/#Tutorials . From the webpage, 
select the Returns heading,  Sales and Use Tax subheading, and select How to File Schedule MV .

711New Tax Rate on Other Tobacco Products  
Effective July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) recently 
approved the new tax rate of 63.49 percent effective July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. The CDTFA is annually required to determine the tax rate on other tobacco products (products other than cigarettes) that is equivalent to the combined rate of tax imposed on cigarettes. 
How tax applies
Tobacco products distributors are required to apply this rate to all distributions of other tobacco products during the effective period. Tobacco products distributors pay this tax upon the distribution of tobacco products in California.
The tax is based on the distributor’s wholesale cost, which is the cost of the 
tobacco products to the distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances (see Revenue and Taxation Code section 30017 and Regulation 4076 ). This cost is 
typically the invoiced price of the tobacco products charged by a manufacturer or importer to the licensed distributor prior to any discounts or trade allowances. 
When is the tax due?
The tobacco products tax is due at the time the tobacco products are distributed in California. The tax rate that applies is the rate in effect at the time the tobacco product 
is sold by the distributor. You may find current and historical tobacco products tax rates on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm .
For more information
For more information regarding cigarette and tobacco products taxes, see our online Tax Guide for Cigarettes and Tobacco Products  at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cigarette-and-tobacco-products.htm , or call our 
Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (CRS:711), Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays; from the main menu select Special Taxes and Fees .

UPDATES FOR RETAILERS OF COINS AND BULLION:  
Exemption Threshold Increase for Bulk Sales of Monetized 
Bullion, Nonmonetized Gold or Silver Bullion,  
and Numismatic Coins  
Now Effective July 1, 2023
The effective date of the recent increase to the exemption threshold for bulk sales of 
monetized bullion, nonmonetized gold or silver bullion, and numismatic coins (coins and bullion) changed from January 1, 2023, to July 1, 2023. Bulk sales of coins and bullion valued at $2,000 and above made after July 1, 2023, are exempt from sales and use tax (tax).
Exemption threshold effective date changes
Recent legislation1 changed the effective date of adjustments to the bulk sales threshold 
amount. Beginning July 1, 2023, the bulk sales exemption threshold increased to $2,000. 
Excess tax reimbursement
If you collected tax on your sales of coins and bullion valued at or above $1,500 but less than $2,000 during first or second quarters of 2023, you must either report and pay it on your sales and use tax returns or refund your customers the excess tax reimbursement collected. If you previously reported and paid the tax to CDTFA and have refunded or plan to refund your customers the excess tax collected, you may file a claim for refund.
2 You 
should retain documentation to support any excess tax refunded.
How is the rate calculated?
We are required3 to calculate what the exemption threshold would be if adjusted for 
changes in the California Consumer Price Index on or before October 1 of each year. The law requires that when the inflation adjusted threshold amount equals or exceeds the operative threshold by five hundred dollars ($500), the threshold automatically increases to that amount, rounded to the nearest multiple of $500, as of the specified effective date. 
Future threshold effective date changes
Increases to the exemption threshold for bulk sales of coins and bullion occurring on or after January 1, 2024, will be operative the first day of the second calendar quarter beginning after the effective date of amendments to Regulation 1599.
4 For example, if 
Regulation 1599 is amended to reflect a new exemption threshold on January 5, 2024, the effective date of the new exemption threshold would be July 1, 2024. We anticipate that the current threshold will remain in effect for several years. We will notify you of any threshold changes in the future.

Auction Houses Beginning January 1, 2021
Beginning January 1, 2021, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration 
(CDTFA) is changing the filing frequency of all used vehicle dealers and vehicle auction houses to a monthly reporting basis and will require the submission of detailed transaction information with the returns for any retail sales of used vehicles. 
Monthly returns must be filed with the CDTFA
If you are a used vehicle dealer and/or vehicle auction house, your filing frequency with the 
CDTFA is being changed to a monthly reporting basis. Your first return for sales made in the month of January 2021 will be due March 1, 2021.
Please provide additional required information on your returns
The CDTFA is requiring that you provide your dealer license number and vehicle sales 
transaction detail for all your retail sales of used vehicles with your returns beginning January 1, 2021. Return instructions will have information on how to provide your vehicle sales transaction detail. 
Sales tax paid to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)
Beginning January 1, 2021, certain used vehicle dealers will also be required to pay sales 
tax on their retail sales of vehicles at the same time they submit a vehicle registration application to the DMV. Pursuant to DMV’s proposed regulations, the DMV will be implementing the new payment requirement in multiple phases through January 1, 2023. The DMV will notify you, in advance, when your payment method is set to change.  You must 
continue to report and remit the taxes due to the CDTFA until you are transitioned to the DMV payment process. Please provide your seller’s permit number on your Report of Sale to ensure your sales tax payment is correctly applied to your CDTFA return.
Legislation information
The reporting basis and payment changes are results of the recent enactment of Assembly 
Bill (AB) 85 (Stats. 2020, ch. 8)
1 and AB 82 (Stats. 2020, ch. 14)2. This applies to vehicle 
dealers, other than new motor vehicle dealers, lessors-retailers, and other specified sellers of vehicles, who hold a license issued pursuant to the Vehicle Code (generally, used vehicle dealers). 
For more information 
We invite you to visit our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov , and specifically our online Tax 
Guide for Motor Vehicle Dealers at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/used-vehicle-dealers.htm  for

Important Cannabis Excise Tax Reminders for Cannabis Retailers and Distributors 
Cannabis Excise Tax Requirements 
Distributors are required to calculate and collect the cannabis excise tax from retailers on the sale or transfer of cannabis 
or cannabis products. Retailers are required to pay the cannabis excise tax to the distributor that supplied the cannabis or cannabis products to a retailer, and the retailers are required to collect the cannabis excise tax from their retail customers. 
Distributors are required to provide retailers with an invoice or receipt that indicates, among other requirements, the amount 
of cannabis excise tax. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) may hold a retailer liable for the cannabis excise tax that is due to the CDFTA without a proper receipt, or proof that the retailer paid the cannabis excise tax to its distributor. 
Retailers are required to collect the cannabis excise tax from their customers. The amount of the cannabis excise tax a 
retailer collects from a customer must be the same amount the distributor collected from the retailer. The retailer may include the cannabis excise tax paid to the distributor as part of the retail selling price of the cannabis or cannabis products. 
Retailers are not required to separately list the cannabis excise tax on their receipts to the retail customer. However, the 
following statement is required to be included on the receipt whether the cannabis excise tax is listed separately or as part of the retail price. 
“The cannabis excise taxes are included in the total amount of this invoice.” 
Distributors’ Reporting Requirements 
Distributors that supply cannabis or cannabis products to a retailer will be held liable for the cannabis excise tax due to 
the CDTFA. Distributors are required to report the cannabis excise tax on their electronic Cannabis Tax Return during the reporting period the distributors sold or transferred cannabis or cannabis products to a retailer. Distributors are required to electronically fle their Cannabis Tax Return and pay the cannabis excise tax due to CDTFA by the last day of the month following the reporting period. 
Arm’s Length Transactions 
In an arm’s length transaction, generally where the distributor is unrelated to the retailer, the distributor calculates the 
15 percent cannabis excise tax due based on the “average market price” of the cannabis or cannabis products sold to the retailer. The “average market price” is computed by applying the CDTFA’s predetermined mark-up rate (currently set at 60 percent) to the retailer’s wholesale cost of the cannabis or cannabis products that were sold to the retailer. The predetermined mark-up rate is only used to calculate the average market price in an arm’s length transaction, and is not intended to be used when determining the retail selling price of the cannabis or cannabis products. 
Nonarm’s Length Transactions 
In a nonarm’s length transaction, generally when the retailer is also the distributor, the 15 percent cannabis excise tax 
is applied to the gross receipts of the retail sale of the cannabis or cannabis products. The distributor in this type of transaction is responsible for reporting and paying the cannabis excise tax to the CDTFA based on the gross receipts of the retail sale. The retailer in this type of transaction is responsible for collecting the cannabis excise tax from the retail customer based on the gross receipts of the retail sale. 
For More Information 
This special notice is intended to give you an overview of some of the requirements for cannabis distributors and retailers 
and does not address all requirements for the cannabis industry. We encourage you to read our online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses  at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm . 
If you have additional questions, you may call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (TTY:711) Monday through 
Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacifc time), except state holidays. Select the option for Special Taxes and Fees .

L-906 (6-23)Exemption Threshold for Bulk Sales of Monetized Bullion, Nonmonetized Gold 
or Silver Bullion, and Numismatic Coins Increased to $2,000
Why we are contacting you
We are sending this letter to let retailers know when a sales and use tax (tax) exemption applies to their 
sales of bulk sales of monetized bullion, nonmonetized gold or silver bullion, and numismatic coins (coins and bullion). If you do not make retail sales of coins and bullion, please disregard this letter.
When the exemption applies
Revenue and Taxation Code (R&TC) section 6355
1 provides a tax exemption for bulk sales of coins and 
bullion. A tax-exempt bulk sale of coins and bullion increased to $2,000 or more on and after January 1, 2023. 
Tax applies to retail sales of coins and bullion valued at less than $2,000 on and after January 1, 2023. 
Regulation 15992, Coins and Bullion , has been amended to include the new bulk sale threshold of $2,000.  
How is the rate calculated?
R&TC section 6355 requires the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) to annually 
calculate what the exemption threshold would be if adjusted for changes in the California Consumer Price Index. It also provides that when that amount, as adjusted for inflation, equals or exceeds the operative exemption threshold by five hundred dollars ($500), the operative threshold automatically increases to that amount, rounded to the nearest multiple of $500, effective January 1 of the succeeding calendar year. 
Relief provisions
If you failed to collect or report tax on transactions involving a sale of coins and bullion during the first or 
second quarter of 2023, please contact our Customer Service Center and ask to speak with a representative in the Information and Advisory Unit, as relief may be available. You may contact our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (CRS:711). Customer service representatives are available Monday through Friday from 
7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific time), except state holidays.

A “covered battery-embedded product” means a new or refurbished product containing a battery from which the battery is not intended to be removed from the product by the consumer with common household tools or is not intended to be removed from the product by the consumer without breach of the product warranty.
SB 1496  (Stats. 2022, ch. 474) Beginning January 1, 2023, 
makes various noncontroversial changes to tax and fee provisions administered by CDTFA. Changes include, but are not limited to, authorization for CDTFA to extend return and payment due dates by three months and grant penalty and interest relief proactively for proclaimed states of emergency, authorizes levy notices to be served electronically to financial institutions, extends Offer in Compromise provisions for open and active businesses to January 1, 2028, and includes minor technical modifications to the Cannabis Tax Law.The following is a summary of law changes enacted during the 2022 California legislative session that affect several CDTFA special tax and fee programs. The changes described in this article are effective January 1, 2023, unless otherwise noted.
Assembly Bill (AB) 194  (Stats. 2022, ch. 55) Provides a 
temporary partial sales and use tax exemption (3.9375%) on the gross receipts from the sale, and the storage, use, or other consumption of, diesel fuel, as defined, starting October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023. This exemption does not apply to those state sales and use tax rates imposed or dedicated for local government funding, including those rates for which revenues are deposited into the Local Revenue Fund 2011, or to those certain additional state sales and use tax rates on the sale or use of diesel fuel. See related article in the 
Diesel and Motor Vehicle Fuel Taxes  section.
AB 195  (Stats. 2022, ch. 56) Simplifies the cannabis tax 
structure to help reduce the burdens for legal operators. The bill discontinues the imposition of the cultivation tax on July 1, 2022, maintains the 15 percent cannabis excise tax and moves the collection and payment requirements to the cannabis retailer beginning on January 1, 2023, creates a new 20 percent vendor compensation for retailers approved for a Department of Cannabis Control equity fee waiver, and provides additional enforcement and collection actions by CDTFA.
AB 203  (Stats. 2022, ch. 60) Requires CDTFA to collect hazardous 
waste facility fees imposed on transportable treatment units on a fiscal year basis with two equal installments due in November and February, and an annual return due with the February installment. The first return due is for the February 2024 period.
AB 211  (Stats. 2022, ch. 574) Specifies that the 2022–23 fiscal 
year hazardous waste facility fees for transportable treatment unit operators are due and payable within 30 days after the date of assessment, requires the feepayer to pay the amount of the assessed fee to CDTFA within that 30-day period, and makes other various changes to public resources provisions.
AB 988  (Stats. 2022, ch. 747) Beginning January 1, 2023, 
imposes a new 988 surcharge on each access line for each month or part thereof for which a service user subscribes with a service supplier and on purchases of prepaid mobile telephony services. The surcharge funds 988 crisis hotline centers to provide crisis intervention services and crisis care coordination to individuals accessing 988. See related article in the 
Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge  section.
AB 2836  (Stats. 2022, ch. 355) Extends the collection of the 
$1.75 California tire fee sunset date from January 1, 2024, to January 1, 2034, and reduces the California tire fee to $0.75 starting January 1, 2034.

DECEMBER 2022  • SPECIAL TAXES AND FEES NEWSLETTER CANNABIS TAXES
Cannabis tax reform
Beginning January 1, 2023, the responsibility for collecting 
and paying the cannabis excise tax shifts from distributors to cannabis retailers.
Distributors (including microbusiness distributors)
Distributors and microbusinesses authorized to distribute cannabis or cannabis products will stop collecting the 15 percent cannabis excise tax from cannabis retailers for cannabis or cannabis products sold or transferred to cannabis retailers on and after January 1, 2023. Cannabis tax accounts held by distributors will automatically be closed out by us. Monthly distributor filers will file their final cannabis tax return for the December 2022 period and quarterly filers will file their final return for the Fourth Quarter 2022 period, which is due January 31, 2023.
Cannabis retailers (including microbusiness retailers)
Starting January 1, 2023, cannabis retailers are responsible for registering for a cannabis retailer excise tax account. In December 2022, we will automatically register cannabis retailers, including microbusiness retailers, with a cannabis retailer excise tax account. If a cannabis retailer was not automatically registered with us, the retailer can register for a cannabis excise tax account through our 
online services .
Additionally, cannabis retailers will be responsible for collecting the 15 percent cannabis excise tax from their customers based on the gross receipts from the retail sale of cannabis or cannabis products made on and after January 1, 2023. Gross receipts include the selling price of cannabis or cannabis products (after discount), and all charges related to the sale, such as a delivery fee and any local cannabis taxes listed separately on the invoice or receipt. For cannabis excise tax purposes, gross receipts do not include sales tax.
Lastly, retailers will be required to file cannabis retailer excise tax returns online with us and pay the cannabis excise tax due for their retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products that are made on and after January 1, 2023.Retailers may:
• Claim a credit on the return for any excise tax paid to a 
distributor for cannabis or cannabis products purchased before January 1, 2023, and sold at retail on or after January 1, 2023.
• Beginning, January 1, 2023, eligible cannabis retailers may apply online to retain vendor compensation equal to 
 
20 percent of the cannabis excise tax due. Prior to applying, a cannabis retailer must already be approved for a fee waiver with the Department of Cannabis Control.
New enforcement provisions
We may hold any officer, member, manager, partner, or other 
person personally liable for any unpaid cannabis taxes, interest, and penalties when a corporation, partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability company fails to pay cannabis taxes due.
We may hold any unlicensed cannabis business liable for cannabis taxes due to us who possesses, keeps, stores, or retains for the purpose of sale, or sells or offers to sell cannabis or cannabis products. A penalty of 25 percent of the tax due or $500, whichever is greater, will be added to any assessment for an unlicensed cannabis business.

DECEMBER 2022  • SPECIAL TAXES AND FEES NEWSLETTER CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS: TAXES AND LICENSING
New law prohibits retail sales of menthol 
cigarettes and most flavored tobacco products
Effective December 21, 2022, cigarette and tobacco products 
retailers may no longer sell, offer, or possess with the intent to sell, menthol cigarettes and most  flavored tobacco products. 
The law does not apply to flavored premium cigars with a wholesale price (retailer's purchase price) of $12.00 or more and flavored loose-leaf pipe tobacco. Flavored shisha/hookah tobacco may be sold in licensed retail stores that only admit persons 21 or older and operate in accordance with all state and/or local laws. Visit the California Department of Public Health’s 
website  for more information, including frequently 
asked questions, a fact sheet, and other useful resources.
For more information, please read Senate Bill 793  
(Stats. 2020, ch. 34), which was upheld by the passage of 
Proposition 31  and added the flavored tobacco sale 
prohibition section 104559.5 to the Health and Safety Code , 
and our special notice, New Law Prohibits Retail Sales of Menthol Cigarettes and Most Flavored Tobacco Products , at

New tax rate for other tobacco  
products effective July 1, 2022,  
through June 30, 2023
The new tax rate for other tobacco products (products other than cigarettes) is 61.74 percent of the wholesale cost, effective July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023. The tax rate is subject to change annually. For more information, please see our special notice, New Tax Rate on Other Tobacco Products Effective July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023 , at

California cigarette tax stamps purchased 
before March 17, 2020, are expiring — claims for refund are now being accepted
There are two versions of red-orange California cigarette tax 
stamps in circulation. Stamps sold before March 17, 2020, will expire in early 2023. Cigarette distributors who purchased these stamps on a cash basis have until March 16, 2023, to file a claim for refund. Distributors who purchased these stamps on a deferred payment basis have until April 25, 2023, to file a claim for refund. We will not accept refund claims for the expiring stamps after these dates.
To submit your claim for refund, log in with your username and password at 
onlineservices.cdtfa.ca.gov . If you submit claims 
for refund for cigarettes from multiple manufacturers, you must file a separate claim for each manufacturer.
The current and expiring stamps look very similar. The easiest way to identify the expiring stamps is to look at the color on the left side of the stamps. The color on the left side of the expiring stamps is darker than on the current stamp. The star on the expiring stamp has a thinner white border, and two of the star points are cut off. Also, there is a larger gap between the star and the letters “CA” on the expiring stamps.
The color of the left side on the current stamp is lighter. Also, the star on the current stamp has a thicker white border, and only one star point is cut off. Finally, the star is set close to the letters “CA.”

DECEMBER 2022  • SPECIAL TAXES AND FEES NEWSLETTER DIESEL AND MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL TAXES
Revisions to Regulation 1435, Tax Paid 
Twice on Diesel Fuel
On February 3, 2022, the California Office of Administrative Law 
approved updates, including a new title to Regulation 1435, Tax Paid Twice on Diesel Fuel , to clarify when a credit or claim 
for refund is allowed for tax paid twice on diesel fuel removed from an approved terminal. The revised regulation is operative February 3, 2022. Below are some key changes to the regulation. We encourage you to read the full text of the regulation.
New title of Regulation 1435: Tax Paid Twice on the 
Amount of Diesel Fuel Removed from an Approved Terminal
The title of Regulation 1435  was updated to better describe the 
intent of the regulation. Additional updates to Regulation 1435 
provide clarification for claiming a tax-paid twice credit for diesel fuel. A supplier with tax-paid diesel fuel inventory at an approved terminal can claim a tax-paid twice credit when it makes removals of its diesel fuel inventory at an approved terminal, provided it meets certain requirements. One of the requirements is that the supplier must maintain an inventory reconciliation of its tax-paid diesel fuel at the approved terminal to verify that it has enough tax-paid diesel fuel inventory to cover the gallons claimed. Below are highlights of some of the changes:
• Deletes references to removal of diesel fuel “on which a 
prior tax was paid,” making refunds or credits available for removals of tax-paid diesel and ex tax diesel.
• Provides language to allow a removal of diesel fuel to be offset by tax-paid inventory held at the same approved terminal.
• Provides clarifying definitions.
• Provides updated conditions for allowing a credit or a claim for refund.
• Provides helpful examples of tax-paid twice on the amount of diesel fuel removed from an approved terminal.
For additional information, please see our online 
Tax Guide for Motor Fuels Taxes .

NEW LEGISLATION 
Senate Bill (SB) 158 (Stats. 2021, ch. 73) revises the Department 
of Toxic Substances Control hazardous substances taxes/fees administered by CDTFA, including changes as follows:
• Repeals the disposal fee, effective June 30, 2022.
• Revises fee payments to coincide with a fiscal year basis, as opposed to a calendar year basis.
• Repeals the generator fee and creates a new generation and handling fee, applied on a per-ton basis, effective January 1, 2022.
• Establishes a new sub-account within the Hazardous Waste Control Account: Hazardous Waste Facility Account.
• Increases the facility and environmental fees, effective January 1, 2022.
See related article in the Hazardous Substances Taxes/Fees  
section.
SB 395  (Stats. 2021, ch. 489) establishes the Health Careers 
Opportunity Grant Program and requires a purchaser of 
electronic cigarettes to pay a tax of 12.5 percent of the gross receipts from the retail sale of electronic cigarettes in California beginning July 1, 2022. The bill requires a retailer to collect the tax from the consumer at the time of the electronic cigarette retail sale.
SB 824  (Stats 2021, ch. 432) makes various changes to statutes 
administered by CDTFA including, but not limited to, the 
following changes. The bill revises the collection cost recovery fee to be an amount less than or equal to CDTFA’s costs for collection. The bill requires prepaid mobile telephony services (MTS) sellers (other than services suppliers) to pay the 911 surcharge imposed on prepaid MTS by electronic funds transfer (EFT) if they pay sales and use tax by EFT. SB 824 aligns the timber yield tax interest rates with other program rates, allows CDTFA to disclose information regarding a marine invasive species fee billing to any agent of a vessel owner or operator, and requires online filing for the cigarette and tobacco products tax and emergency telephone users surcharge (ETUS). The bill also repeals CDTFA’s exemption from the Administrative Procedures Act for purposes of adopting regulations, allows additional disclosure of information for cigarette and tobacco products, childhood lead prevention, and ETUS programs, and makes changes to ETUS and timber yield tax penalty provisions.The following is a summary of law changes enacted during the 2021 California legislative session that affect several CDTFA special tax and fee programs. The changes described in this 
article are effective January 1, 2022, unless otherwise noted.
Assembly Bill (AB) 141 (Stats. 2021, ch. 70) effective 
July 12, 2021, consolidates the three state cannabis programs into one new state department, the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) within the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency, and transfers the corresponding powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities to that department. DCC regulations allow cannabis or cannabis products to be designated as a trade sample by certain licensees. On and after January 1, 2022, AB 141 also exempts from the cultivation tax all harvested cannabis that will be, or has been, designated a trade sample and all harvested cannabis that is used to manufacture a cannabis product that is designated a trade sample. See related article in the Cannabis Taxes  section.
AB 148  (Stats. 2021, ch. 115) effective July 22, 2021, expands 
the registration requirement for the oil spill prevention and administration (OSPA) fee to include two new facility types: renewable fuel production facility and renewable fuel receiving facility. Beginning October 1, 2021, AB 148 increases the OSPA fee on crude oil and petroleum products from six and one-half cents ($0.065) to eight and one-half cents ($0.085) per barrel. Beginning January 1, 2022, it expands the imposition of the OSPA fee to include renewable fuel. Starting July 1, 2023, the bill requires the annual OSPA fee rate adjustments to be based on changes in the California Consumer Price Index. AB 148 also requires online filing for the monthly OSPA fee return. See related articles in the Oil Spill Prevention and Administration Fees & Oil Spill Response Fee  
section.
AB 1402  (Stats. 2021, ch. 421) amends the Marketplace 
Facilitator Act to require marketplace facilitators to register with 
CDTFA to collect and pay certain fees administered according to the Fee Collection Procedures Law (FCPL) that are imposed upon the retail sale of tangible personal property in California. For purposes of AB 1402, fees administered according to the FCPL include the California tire fee, the covered electronic waste recycling (eWaste) fee, the lumber products assessment, 
and the California battery fee.

CANNABIS TAXES
DECEMBER 2021 • SPECIAL TAXES AND FEES NEWSLETTER 
Cannabis tax rates
Cannabis excise tax mark-up rate
We are responsible for determining the cannabis mark-up rate 
every six months. We have determined the cannabis mark-up rate will remain at 80 percent for the period of January 1, 2022, through June 30, 2022. The mark-up rate must be used by distributors to compute the average market price of cannabis or cannabis products sold or transferred to a cannabis retailer in an arm’s length transaction. 
Cultivation tax rates
Beginning January 1, 2022, the cultivation tax rates reflect an adjustment for inflation as required by the Cannabis Tax Law. The adjusted rates for each category (flowers, leaves, and fresh cannabis plant) will be reflected on the monthly and quarterly cannabis tax returns beginning January 1, 2022.
Please see our special notice , Cannabis Rates Effective 
January 1, 2022 , for additional information.
For the current and prior cannabis tax rates, see our 
Special Taxes and Fees Rates webpage under Cannabis Taxes .
Cannabis trade samples
California law allows certain cannabis licensees to provide cannabis trade samples to other licensees for targeted advertising of cannabis or cannabis products. Cannabis or cannabis products provided to other cannabis licensees as trade samples are exempt from the cultivation tax and the cannabis excise tax (see Assembly Bill 141 (Stats. 2021, ch. 70) ).
For more information regarding the application of the cannabis taxes on cannabis trade samples and documentation guidance, please see our special notice , Cannabis Trade 
Samples Exempt from Cannabis Taxes, and view the Cannabis Trade Samples section under each tab in our Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses .Cannabis excise tax
Arm’s length or non-arm’s length transaction
To properly calculate the 15 percent cannabis excise tax, cannabis distributors must determine whether the sale or transfer to the cannabis retailer is considered an arm’s length transaction  or a non-arm’s length transaction .
What is an arm’s length transaction?
An arm’s length transaction is defined as a sale, entered into in good faith, between the cannabis retailer and its supplier at a sales price that reflects the fair market value in the open market between two informed and willing parties, neither under any compulsion to participate in the transaction.
What is a non-arm’s length transaction?
A non-arm’s length transaction is a transaction that does not meet the definition of an arm’s length transaction, meaning there is no good faith sale to a cannabis retailer at a fair market price. An example is when a distributor sells cannabis to a cannabis retailer that has common ownership with the distributor, at a discounted price that does not reflect fair market value, offered only to this cannabis retailer with the same common ownership.
For more information and examples regarding arm’s length 
and non-arm’s length transactions, and how to calculate the cannabis excise tax for each type of transaction, please view the following two tax facts that are located in ou r 
Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses under the  Tax Facts  tab.

Regulation 4077 , Tobacco Product Manufacturer , defines a 
tobacco product manufacturer and clarifies when a tobacco 
retailer is and is not a tobacco product manufacturer.
A tobacco product manufacturer is:
• Any person, including any repacker or relabeler, who

• An owner of a brand or formula for a tobacco product, who contracts with another person to complete the fabrication and assembly of the product to the brand or formula owner’s standard.
• A retailer who mixes, blends, or combines a tobacco product that is not suitable for human consumption, such as liquid nicotine, with other ingredients or components to make a tobacco product that is suitable for human consumption.
A tobacco product manufacturer who is also a tobacco product retailer must also register as a tobacco products distributor.
A tobacco product retailer is not a tobacco product 
manufacturer when a retailer:
• Packages liquid nicotine with other items or finished tobacco products together as one unit.
• Allows customers to mix, blend, or combine liquid nicotine and other components after a sale.
• Mixes, blends, or combines finished tobacco products, such as pipe tobacco.
A tobacco retailer who is not licensed as a tobacco product manufacturer, importer, or distributor must purchase tobacco products from a licensed tobacco products distributor or wholesaler.

Product Manufacturer .6
Important changes to Regulation 4076,

Products , provide clarification for calculating your wholesale 
cost of tobacco products for tax purposes. Some important 
changes include:

• • sold for a single price before or when the liquid or 
substance containing nicotine is distributed.
• Describes the costs included in manufacturing costs if a manufacturer or an importer is also the distributor.

DIESEL AND MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL TAXES
Diesel and motor vehicle fuel  
online filing tips
Diesel and motor vehicle fuel returns, reports, and refund claims 
have supporting schedules containing transaction level details of fuel movements. Here are some of the more common diesel and motor vehicle fuel filing issues, along with potential solutions:
• Failure to upload error: This issue is often caused by using a file template that is corrupt or outdated. Using the most current template, which you will find on our Motor Fuels Online Filing  
webpage, will often solve this problem.
• Data format errors: These errors often occur when data formatted as general or text is downloaded into a schedule field that is formatted for numeric values. To avoid this error, ensure that the numbers are formatted as numeric. Also, we suggest removing leading zeros and extra non-numeric characters from numbers.
• Date errors: This issue can occur when using a stored filing template. Remember to update the filing period each time a file is submitted. This prevents duplicate filings and alleviates potential tax return delinquency issues.
• Payment errors: When a payment is included in the EDI or FLT submission, it is not necessary to select Make a Payment on the return submission confirmation page. When a payment is included in both the EDI or FLT and the return submission page, a duplicate payment can occur.
The latest filing templates, instructions, data formats, and filing examples can be accessed on our M otor Fuels Online Filin g 
webpage.7

International Fuel Tax Agreement 
- recordkeeping and reporting responsibilities
The International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) is an 
agreement among U.S. states and provinces in Canada, that simplifies the reporting of fuel use taxes by interstate motor carriers operating in two or more member states or provinces. The purpose of IFTA is to establish and maintain a single fuel tax license for all your qualified motor vehicles (QMV), authorizing them to travel in all IFTA jurisdictions, and requiring you to file only one tax return each quarter with your base jurisdiction to report your fuel usage and mileage for all IFTA member states and provinces. As an IFTA licensee, your responsibilities are to:
• Prepare and maintain operational records for each QMV to support all distance traveled, all fuel purchases, and other information required by IFTA.
• Maintain these records for a period of four years from the due date of your quarterly fuel use tax return, or the date the return was filed, whichever is later.
• Report your travel and fuel purchases for each QMV on the IFTA Carrier Return.
• Complete and file the quarterly IFTA Carrier Return on or before the due date for each reporting period. You must pay amounts due on or before the due date of the return or billing.• Display an IFTA decal on each side of the cab on each of your QMVs. You must keep a copy of your IFTA license in the cab of each of your QMVs. 
You can find detailed information on each of the above requirements in publication 50 , A Guide to the International Fuel Tax Agreement.

TIMBER YIELD TAXDECEMBER 2021 • SPECIAL TAXES AND FEES NEWSLETTER 
Interest and penalty changes for the Timber Yield Tax Program
Senate Bill 824 (Stats. 2021, ch. 432) revises the method of determining interest on timber yield tax underpayments and 
overpayments for all taxpayers. It also changes the timber yield tax interest accrual from daily to monthly.
SB 824 allows us to compute interest due on a timber yield tax late payment on a daily basis in cases where an electronic tax 
payment was made one business day late, provided all of the following apply: 
• The payment was made by electronic means (for example, payments made by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), credit card, or ACH debit through our online services) and was made no more than one business day after the due date, 
• The taxpayer was granted relief from all penalties that applied to the tax payment, and 
• The taxpayer filed a request for an adjustment to the interest computation with us. 
Lastly, SB 824 modifies the timber yield tax late filing penalty to be either 10 percent or $100, whichever is greater, if the tax return is not filed by its due date.
For more information about the timber yield tax, please see our Tax Guide for Timber Yield Tax .We’ve updated the impacted definitions that are listed on 
your CDTFA-501-IR  return and included a note stating, “ As of 
July 22, 2021, the definition of petroleum products changed to remove reference to alcohol fuels that contain petroleum products and includes renewable fuel containing more than five percent (5%) petroleum products.”AB 148  (Stats. 2021, ch. 115) made several changes to the 
oil spill prevention and administration fee; however, the only changes that impact the oil spill response fee are the new and revised definitions.
Therefore, there are no changes to the CDTFA-501-IR regarding 
who needs to file the return and the product categories (crude oil and petroleum products) that must be reported.11

for documenting sales of lead-acid batteries or replacement lead-acid batteries (batteries) that are excluded or exempt from the California battery fee and/or manufacturer battery fee (lead-acid battery fees).
Documenting an exclusion or exemption 
If you are a manufacturer or dealer (seller), you must obtain written certification from your customer to support that the lead-acid battery or a replacement lead-acid battery will be used in an exempt or excluded manner and the purchase is not subject to the lead-acid 
 
battery fee(s). You may accept CDTFA-230-L , General Exclusion and Exemption 
Certificate—For Lead-Acid Batteries Not Subject to the Lead-Acid Battery Fees , from 
your customer to document your excluded or exempt sale. It is located on our website at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/DownloadFile.ashx?path=/formspubs/cdtfa230l.pdf . This completed 
form meets the certification requirements provided in Regulation 3240.
Drop shipments 
A drop shipper owes the lead-acid battery fee(s) when the drop shipment meets the following two conditions:
•A California retailer makes the drop shipment on behalf of an out-of-state retailer to aconsumer in California, and
•The out-of-state retailer does not hold a California seller’s permit or a CaliforniaCertificate of Registration—Use Tax.

Changes to Cannabis Excise and Cultivation Taxes Regulation 
The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) recently adopted Regulation 3700, Cannabis Excise and 
Cultivation Taxes , which addresses and clarifes the Cannabis Tax Law regarding the administration of the cannabis excise 
and cultivation taxes. The effective date of the regulation is September 4, 2019, unless otherwise specifed in the regulation. 
New wholesale cost defnition 
Effective January 1, 2020, the wholesale cost defnition will mean the amount paid by the cannabis retailer for cannabis or 
cannabis products, including transportation charges. The wholesale cost plus a mark-up rate determined by the CDTFA is used to determine the average market price of the cannabis or cannabis products sold in an arm’s length transaction. The 15 percent cannabis excise tax applies to the average market price of cannabis or cannabis products sold in a retail sale. Prior to January 1, 2020, the wholesale cost is the amount paid by the retailer, including transportation charges and adding 
back any discounts or trade allowances . 
Cannabis or cannabis products sold with cannabis accessories 
Generally, the 15 percent cannabis excise tax does not apply to accessories. However, when a distributor does not 
separately state the sales price of the cannabis or cannabis products sold or transferred with cannabis accessories (for example, vape cartridges) to a cannabis retailer, the cost of the accessory is included in the calculation of the average market price when determining the cannabis excise tax due. 
Other miscellaneous changes 
•Adds the defnition of the California Cannabis Track-and-Trace system.
•Clarifes the defnition of cannabis accessories, cannabis fowers, and fresh cannabis plant.
•Adds the cultivation tax invoicing requirements and clarifes the invoicing requirements when there are multiple licensees
in a transaction.
The distributor that conducts the fnal quality assurance review on the cannabis or cannabis products is responsible for reporting and paying the cultivation tax to the CDTFA. 
•Clarifes information cannabis retailers must  include on their receipts to purchasers.
•Clarifes how a cannabis retailer or a distributor shall handle any excess cannabis excise tax collected from a purchaser.
•Clarifes when the cannabis excise tax shall be collected when there are multiple distributors involved in a transaction.
The distributor that supplies a retailer with cannabis or cannabis products is responsible for reporting and paying the cannabis excise tax to the CDTFA. 
Please see the current text of Regulation 3700, Cannabis Excise and Cultivation Taxes , at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov/lawguides/vol3/ctr/ctr-reg3700.html . 
For more information 
This special notice is intended to give you an overview of some of the requirements for the cannabis industry and does not 
address all requirements for the cannabis industry. We encourage you to read our online Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses 
at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm . You may also call our Customer Service Center at 1-800-400-7115 (CRS:711). 
Customer service representatives are available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Pacifc time), except state

711New Tax Rates and Storage Tax Requirement 
for Motor Vehicle and Diesel Fuels 
Effective November 1, 2017
The Governor signed Senate Bill (SB) 1 (Stats. 2017 , Ch. 5), The Road Repair and Accountability Act 
of 2017 , which increases the excise tax rates on motor vehicle fuel (MVF) and diesel fuel, and the 
sales and use tax rate on retail sales of diesel fuel effective November 1, 2017 . In addition to the fuel tax rate increase, retailers, wholesalers, and suppliers who hold in inventory tax paid MVF or diesel fuel on November 1, 2017 , at 12:01 a.m., will need to file a storage tax return and pay a storage tax. The storage tax return and payment is due no later than January 1, 2018. 
Tax rates - motor vehicle fuel, diesel fuel, and sales and use tax
The excise tax rate for MVF will increase from $0.297 to $0.417 per gallon (an increase of $0.12 
per gallon), the excise tax rate for diesel fuel will increase from $0.16 to $0.36 per gallon (an increase of $0.20 per gallon), and the additional statewide sales and use tax rate imposed on retail sales of diesel fuel will increase from 1.75 percent to 5.75 percent (an increase of 4.00 percent). The tax rates are as follows:
Excise Tax Rates Per Gallon
Type of Fuel Through October 31, 2017 Effective November 1, 2017
Gasoline (Motor vehicle fuel) 29.7 cents ($0.297) 41.7 cents ($0.417)

Diesel fuel 16 cents ($0.16) 36 cents ($0.36)
Aviation Gasoline118 cents ($0.18) 18 cents ($0.18)

The storage tax will be due on a per-gallon basis on MVF and diesel fuel that has not been 
subject to the tax increase. Retailers, wholesalers, and suppliers will be required to file a return and pay the storage tax by January 1, 2018. We will provide additional information about filing the storage tax return in a future notice.

L-504Partial exemption from the sales and use tax rate – diesel fuel sales
There are two types of partial exemptions from the sales and use tax on diesel sales. 
Below are the sales and use tax rates on diesel fuel sold under an exemption certificate for qualified farming activities and food processing, and for other off-highway uses, including exempt bus operations. These partially exempt rates are not impacted by the SB 1 rate increases:

1 You must add district taxes where applicable. District tax rates for your area are available on our website at www.cdtfa.ca.gov .
Mid-period sales and use tax rate increase 
Fuel retailers will be reporting sales of diesel fuel at two different rates for the fourth 
quarter 2017 . Diesel fuel sales from November 1 through December 31 will be subject to an additional 4 percent tax. Our online filing system will be updated to reflect these changes so that users may allocate sales to the proper periods and report sales at the correct rate. 
Reminder – sales tax included diesel fuel prices
In general, the retail sales price of diesel fuel includes sales tax, as well as federal and 
state excise taxes. Therefore, it is important that you remember to apply the correct sales and use tax rate when calculating the tax collected on sales of diesel fuel sold at retail on or after November 1, 2017 , and when computing and reporting the sales tax included deduction. Additionally, it is important that you remember that the 36 cents per gallon diesel fuel tax (state) is excluded from the gross receipts subject to sales tax. A tax-included price for diesel fuel is computed as follows. Please note, applicable district tax rate(s) would be added in addition to the sales tax rate:
Price per gallon of diesel fuel before state and federal taxes  $ 2.574  
Federal excise tax  +0.244  
Amount subject to sales tax  2 .818 
Sales tax [$2.818 x 13.0%]  0 .366 
State diesel fuel excise tax  +0.360  
Tax-included selling price  $3.544
Sales of fuel to Native American Indian retailers on an Indian reservation 
As a general reminder, MVF and diesel fuel sold to Native American Indian retailers on 
an Indian reservation are subject to the state excise tax (MVF tax or diesel fuel tax) and the requirement to collect prepaid sales tax. Current law does not provide an exemption for collecting prepaid sales tax on sales of fuel to an Indian retailer on an Indian reservation. Although sales tax may not apply to retail sales of fuel by Indian retailers, the Indian retailer is generally required to collect use tax on sales of fuel to non-Indians and Indians not residing on a reservation.

Certain Used Motor Vehicle Dealers Required to Pay Tax to 
the Department of Motor Vehicles Beginning January 1, 2023
On January 1, 2023, certain used motor vehicle dealers (dealers) will be required to pay 
sales tax, including district taxes, on their retail sales of used motor vehicles, directly to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) when they submit a vehicle registration application. Please refer to the information below to see if this impacts your business. We have also included some helpful tips, reminders, and resources to help you prepare your sales and use tax returns.
New payment requirements 
Dealers that currently pay tax to CDTFA and who made fewer than 300 retail vehicle sales 
in calendar year 2021 will be required to pay tax to DMV beginning January 1, 2023. Dealers that meet this requirement will receive a separate notice advising them of their tax payment requirement. Additional dealers will be required to pay tax to DMV in subsequent years according to the recent enactment of Senate Bill 1496 (Stats. 2022, ch. 474)
1.
Tips and reminders
If you are currently paying tax to DMV, or if your payment method is scheduled to change 
on January 1, 2023, please review the following tips and reminders to assist you in reporting and making payments.
Sales and use tax reporting
• You must continue to file your sales and use tax return on time with CDTFA and 
include all of your retail sales of used motor vehicles, including those sales for which the tax was paid to DMV. You must also include your sales of other items such as batteries, tires, and service center sales on your sales and use tax return. 
• Tax is due on an accrual basis, which means you must report your sales in the period the sales occur. For example, if you make a sale in February, receive payment from your customer in March, and register the vehicle and pay the tax to DMV in March, you must report the sale on your February  sales and use tax return. The 
sales date is the Report of Sale (ROS) date for the vehicle sold.

711• Certain charges are considered taxable when made in connection with the sale of a 
vehicle. Since DMV only collects the tax based on the vehicle sales price, you must report other taxable charges, where the tax is not paid to DMV, such as document fees, smog certification fees, mandatory warranties, among others, on your sales and use tax return on line 1, Total Sales , to pay the tax due on these charges. For 
example, if the vehicle selling price is $10,000, and your other taxable charges related to the sale of the vehicle are $500, DMV will collect tax based on the $10,000 vehicle selling price. You must report $10,500, which includes both the selling price of the vehicle and other taxable charges, on line 1 of your sales and use tax return. 
DMV payments
• You must complete and submit an ROS, as required by California Vehicle Code section 4456
3.
• You must provide DMV your seller’s permit number along with your tax payment to ensure we are able to apply your payment to your sales and use tax account.  Please note : If you use a service provider to electronically report vehicle sales, 
contact your provider to ensure your seller’s permit number is accurately recorded on each ROS. 
• You may contact DMV by email at DMVTAXINQ@dmv.ca.gov  for confirmation of your 
payments.   
Please note: Invalid or missing information can delay the posting of your payments and may result in CDTFA issuing you a bill.

711Tobacco Product Sales by Out-of-State 
Distributors to In-State Distributors
The sale of other tobacco products (OTP) by an out-of-state California-licensed tobacco 
products distributor to an in-state California-licensed tobacco products distributor is not  
considered a distribution of OTP in California by the out-of-state seller. Instead, the licensed distributor in California who purchases the OTP from out-of-state and who makes the distribution of OTP in this state owes the applicable excise tax. 
License Requirements
An out-of-state distributor who is  engaged in business in California must have a California 
distributor license for licensing and tax reporting purposes (Revenue and Taxation 
Code [R &TC] section 30108 ). An out-of-state distributor who is not engaged in business 
in California may apply for a distributor license ( R&TC section 30140.1 ) for licensing 
and tax reporting purposes. Out-of-state California-licensed distributors have the same responsibilities and requirements as in-state California-licensed distributors. 
“Engaged in business” includes, but is not limited to:
• Maintaining, occupying, or using any type of business location. This includes use 
that is temporary, direct or indirect, or through any type of subsidiary or agent.
• Having a representative in California who sells, delivers, or takes orders of OTP .
Distributor licenses are required for each business location that distributes OTP in California ( R&TC section 30140 ). A warehouse/storage location is not considered a location 
that distributes OTP unless direct OTP distributions are made from that warehouse/storage location. 
Calculation of Tax
The excise tax is due on the distributor’s wholesale cost of the OTP . The distributor’s 
wholesale cost is usually the list price on their purchase invoice from their supplier prior to any discounts or trade allowances. The tax rate that applies is the rate in effect at the time the distributor sells the OTP . For additional information on the wholesale cost, please read Regulation 4076 , Wholesale Cost of Tobacco Products . Distributors responsible for paying the 
excise tax on taxable distributions (sales) must: indicate the excise tax on the sales invoice issued to customers; calculate the excise tax due based on their wholesale cost; report their distribution of the OTP , based on the date sold, on the tax return ( Tobacco Products 
Distributor Tax Return ) provided by the state; and, pay the total amount due to the state.
For More Information
Current and historical tobacco products tax rates are available on our website at 
www.cdtfa.ca.gov .
For more information regarding cigarette and tobacco products taxes, please refer to the online Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax and Fee guide at www.cdtfa.ca.gov , or call our

L-832Hazardous Waste Facility Fee Changes to Your 
Payments, Reporting Basis, and New Fee Rates 
Effective January 1, 2022
A new law increases the hazardous waste facility fee rates and makes major changes to the 
fee program ( Senate Bill 158 ; Stats. 2021, ch.73).
New reporting requirements
Your reporting basis will change from a calendar year basis to a fiscal year basis starting July 1, 2022. Below are your new reporting requirements:
• Continue to make your 2022 prepayment which is due by February 28, 2022. 
• File an online return for the transitional period from January 1, 2022, through June  30, 2022. This six-month return is due by August 31, 2022. 
• The fiscal year 2022/2023 return is due February 28, 2023.
New payment dates
Beginning July 1, 2022, you are required to pay your facility fee for each reporting period in two equal payments as noted below:

Facilities may also owe the generation and handling fee
Previously, facilities that paid the facility fee were not subject to the generator fee. However, beginning January 1, 2022, facilities that generate five (5) or more tons of hazardous waste per site during a calendar year or portion of a calendar year, must also register, file a return, and pay the generation and handling fee. Use our Online Services  system to register.
A permitted facility may deduct from the amount of hazardous waste subject to the generation and handling fee the amount of waste that is stored, bulked, or transferred from that facility to another authorized facility for management according to Health and Safety Code section 25205.5(a)(4) . For additional information about the generation and 
handling fee, please see our special notice , Hazardous Waste Generation and Handling Fee

What You Need to Know: 
Reporting Requirement for Sales Made on  
State-Designated Fairgrounds 
In 2018, we informed retailers who make sales of goods or merchandise on California state-
designated fair property (“state-designated fairground”) that they must also separately state the amount of those sales on their sales and use tax return. The separately reported amount is used for funding purposes only; there is no additional tax or fee due on these sales. This requirement was effective July 1, 2018.
We want to help you correctly report the sales that you make at a state-designated 
fairground. This notice provides guidance and examples on how to report these sales on your return.
State-Designated Fairgrounds
A state-designated fairground means the California Exposition and State Fair in the 
City of Sacramento and other fairgrounds throughout the state
1. Currently, there are 
more than 70 fairs held throughout California. See the List of State-Designated Fairs at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/state-fairgrounds-list.htm . If you made any sales of goods 
or merchandise on any of the listed fairgrounds, you must separately report those amounts on your sales and use tax return. The separately-stated amount must include sales that took place at any time and at any event on the state-designated fairground, not just during an actual fair.
How do I report sales made on a state-designated fairground?
For return periods starting July 1, 2018, we added an additional line on both the online and 
paper returns for sales taking place on a California state-designated fairground. When you file online, you will be asked if you made sales on state-designated fairgrounds. After you select “Yes,” you will enter your sales of goods made on a state-designated fairground on the next screen. You should have this amount ready before you begin your online return. You will also see instructions and the link to the list of fairgrounds. Enter only the amount of sales of goods made on a state-designated fairground, and only for the period in which you are reporting. Do not report cumulative sales for the year unless you are on a yearly reporting basis.
Once you enter your sales on state-designated fairgrounds, you can complete your return 
as normal. You should report all your taxable and nontaxable sales, including any sales made on a state-designated fairground, on the Total sales  line. Reporting an amount on 
the state-designated fairgrounds line does not affect any other part of your return or the calculation of your tax liability. You will not be taxed twice for these sales.
The examples on page 2 show how to correctly report state-designated fairground sales.

During first quarter 2019, you made sales of $150,000 at your storefront location. You also 
participated as a vendor selling wine at the Napa Town and Country Fair, a state-designated fairground, where you made additional sales of $50,000. You will report the $50,000 made at the fairground on the Sales at state-designated fairgrounds  line and your total sales of 
$200,000, which includes both your storefront sales and the fairground sales, on the Total sales  line.
Example 2
During third quarter 2019, you made no sales at your storefront location; however, you 
participated as a vendor selling gardening tools at the Schools’ Agriculture and Nutrition Program Fair, which is held at a state-designated fairground, where you made sales of $30,000. You will report the $30,000 made at the fairground on the Sales at state-designated fairgrounds  line. You must also report the $30,000 in sales on the Total sales  
line.
Example 3
During fourth quarter 2019, you made sales of $160,000 at your car dealership. You also 
were a vendor selling car accessories at a trade show where you sold $10,000 in car accessories. This trade show was not  held on a state-designated fairground. Because you 
did not make any sales on a state-designated fairground, you are not required to separately report your trade show sales. You will report $170,000 in sales on the Total sales  line.

CDTFA Requires a Power of Attorney for  
Marine Agents to Act on Behalf of Owner/Operators  
on Marine Invasive Species Fee Law Matters
Due to confidentiality restrictions in the Marine Invasive Species Law, we require a Power 
of Attorney (POA) form on file to allow us to provide billings to marine agents. Alternatively, an Agent Agreement that contains authorizing language for an agent to act on behalf of the owner/operator with respect to all marine invasive species fee matters will meet this requirement. 
Please note:  If you receive your marine invasive species fee billings directly from us 
and do not use a marine agent for processing them, you may disregard this notice.
If you are an owner or operator who utilizes marine agents:
• Complete, sign, and return CDTFA-392 , Power of Attorney, or provide an agent 
agreement, such as CDTFA-5226 , Marine Invasive Species Fee – Agent Agreement, 
authorizing the marine agent to act on your behalf on matters relating to the marine 
invasive species fee.
• You need to submit a POA or agent agreement for each marine agent for which you have an established relationship. However, you only need one POA or agent agreement 
per marine agent as it will cover all vessels the marine agent handles for you
What does this mean for marine agents?
• Unless we have a POA or agent agreement on file, we will not provide marine 
invasive species fee billings to you.
 ○Please work with your vessel owners or operators to obtain a signed POA or agent agreement as soon as possible.
Where can I find the CDTFA-392, Power of Attorney,  or CDTFA-5226, Marine 
Invasive Species Fee – Agent Agreement forms?
• CDTFA-392 , Power of Attorney, is available on our website. You can complete the 
form online, save it and either email the PDF version to us, or print a hardcopy and mail it to us at the address which follows.
• CDTFA-5226 , Marine Invasive Species Fee – Agent Agreement,  is available on 
our website. You can print it and complete it, and either scan it and email the PDF version to us or mail a hardcopy to us at the address which follows.
How do I ensure the POA will only apply to the applicable vessels?
Here are some tips for completing a POA specific for the Marine Invasive Species Fee Program:
• Appointee Name  – You may leave this field blank.
• Appointee Business Name  - Enter the marine agent’s name.
• Tax or Fee Matters – Check the Other  box and indicate Marine Invasive Species Fee.
• Specify the Tax or Fee Year(s) or Period(s) – Insert the current date followed by the word “forward,” for example, April 23, 2020 forward. 
• Specific Authorization – Check this box.
• To Other Acts (specify): Check this box and indicate, To receive marine invasive species fee billings from the CDTFA and pay the fee to the CDTFA.
• If you have multiple marine agents, fill in the section beginning with , This Power of 
Attorney Revokes all earlier Power(s) of Attorney or agent agreements on file.

Marketplace Sellers May Be Affected by New 
Marketplace Facilitator Act Beginning October 1, 2019
If you are a marketplace seller that sells tangible merchandise through a marketplace, such 
as an Internet website, beginning October 1, 2019, you may not be responsible for the sales or use tax on your marketplace sales for delivery to California customers. 
Beginning October 1, 2019, a marketplace facilitator  that is registered or required to be 
registered as a retailer with the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration 
(CDTFA) will generally be responsible for paying the sales tax or collecting and paying the use tax on all retail sales for delivery to California customers facilitated through its marketplace. 
This new requirement is included in the Marketplace Facilitator Act , added by Assembly Bill 
147
1 (Stats. 2019, ch. 5) and amended by Senate Bill 922 (Stats. 2019, ch. 34). 
General definitions 
The following are the general definitions for terms used in the Marketplace Facilitator Act :
• Marketplace  – a physical or electronic place where a marketplace seller sells or offers for
sale tangible merchandise for delivery in this state.
• Marketplace facilitator  – in general, a person who contracts with marketplace sellers to
facilitate the sale of the marketplace sellers’ products through a marketplace operated by
the person or a related person when other statutory requirements are met.
• Marketplace seller  – a person who has an agreement with a marketplace facilitator and
makes retail sales of tangible merchandise through a marketplace owned, operated, or
controlled by a marketplace facilitator.
Marketplace sellers
If you are a marketplace seller, beginning October 1, 2019, you are not responsible for 
reporting and paying the sales and use tax to the CDTFA on retail sales of your tangible merchandise facilitated through a marketplace owned, operated, or controlled by a marketplace facilitator that is registered or required to be registered with the CDTFA  as a retailer. 
General  registration and filing information
Many marketplace sellers may not need to be registered with CDTFA. However, whether a 
marketplace seller is required to be registered with CDTFA will depend on several variables, including the location of the property being sold and the amount of sales to California customers. Please see our online guide, Marketplace Facilitator Act , at www.cdtfa.ca.gov/
industry/MPFAct.htm , for additional information.
If you are required to be registered and file returns with the CDTFA, please include those marketplace-facilitated sales in your reported total sales on your sales and use tax return. You may claim a deduction as “other” on your return for those facilitated sales on and after October 1, 2019.
